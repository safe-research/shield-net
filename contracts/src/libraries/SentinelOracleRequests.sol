    // now touches at most that one slot for its state, instead of spreading across three slots'

    // consideration for `SentinelOracleRequestMap.get()`'s existence check -- that check lives

    // that don't otherwise need one (`claim`, `timeoutArbitration`).

    // everything `commit` (`commitDeadline`+`bondTarget`) and `reveal` (`commitDeadline`+
    // `revealDeadline`) need, so both become single-slot `Terms` reads; `daoFeeShare` rides along
    // for `finalize`/`resolveDispute`'s `applyDaoFeeCut`.
    // slot 2 = `sponsor`+`slashAmount` (32 of 32 bytes, exact) -- both only read by the low-frequency,
    // once-per-request calls (`finalize`, `claim`, `resolveDispute`, `timeoutArbitration`), never by

    // block-number type exactly, rather than a narrower onchain-only width. Sentinel counts fit in
