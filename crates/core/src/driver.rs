//! Service driver.
//!
//! Ties the core building blocks together into a running service: it follows
//! the chain with an [`indexer`](crate::index), feeds block updates to the
//! [`transaction queue`](crate::tx) for its per-block housekeeping, and feeds
//! every update and completed effect to the [`state machine`](crate::state).
//! Effects produced by the state machine run concurrently, while actions are
//! encoded into transactions by the [`Service`] and queued for submission.
//! After dispatching a new block's commands, the driver awaits effect handler
//! housekeeping with the same chain view it prunes state snapshots to.
