//! R-4.4 worked example: CoW Protocol's own expected
//! transaction shape. A genuine CoW Swap interaction is never a standalone
//! ERC-20 `approve` — the Safe's own frontend always batches the `approve`
//! (to CoW's canonical `GPv2VaultRelayer`) together with the call that
//! actually commits the Safe to an order: a swap's `setPreSignature`
//! presignature call to `GPv2Settlement`, or a TWAP order's creation call
//! (`ComposableCoW.createWithContext`, `handler` set to the canonical TWAP
//! contract and `factory` set to the canonical `CurrentBlockTimestampFactory`
//! — the Safe app always creates a TWAP order "starting now", which is
//! exactly what routing through that factory encodes on-chain).
//!
//! This registry (`GPv2VaultRelayer`/`GPv2Settlement`/`ComposableCoW`/TWAP
//! handler addresses) is deliberately local to this checker. The base
//! checker's allow-lists are Safe-native protocol constants, whereas these
//! are one third-party dapp's addresses that only this check needs today.
//!
//! **Denies, rather than exempts.** A standalone `approve` to
//! `GPv2VaultRelayer` — not co-batched with a recognized trigger call — is
//! denied under [`RuleId::R4_4AuthorizationTarget`], including when
//! the sentinel engine's address-poisoning checker would otherwise have
//! considered secure from a prior genuine interaction: this
//! protocol-specific rule runs ahead of, and overrides, that general
//! history-based bypass (`CowChecker` runs before
//! [`crate::checkers::AddressPoisoningChecker`] in the engine's checker
//! chain).
//!
//! **A batched TWAP order is checked against the order itself**
//! ([`CowChecker::check_twap_batch`]), deliberately scoped
//! narrow: only an exact 2-call batch — one `approve`, one TWAP
//! `createWithContext` — in either order — is recognized at all; anything
//! else (different batch size, two of the same kind, or a `factory` other
//! than the canonical `CurrentBlockTimestampFactory`) is `Abstain` (from
//! this check specifically — [`CowChecker::check_dangling_approval`] still
//! denies the lone `approve` it leaves behind, the same as an unrecognized
//! handler). A TWAP order's sell token, receiver, and total sell amount
//! (`partSellAmount * n`) are decodable directly from the
//! `createWithContext` call's own `staticInput` — no RPC or offchain call
//! needed, since the order's terms are committed onchain at creation time.
//! Once recognized, the pair is denied under
//! [`RuleId::R4_4AuthorizationTarget`] if the order's receiver isn't the
//! Safe itself (the same address-poisoning-style target-manipulation
//! concern as a wrong `approve` spender), or under
//! [`RuleId::R4_5ExcessiveApproval`] if the approved token doesn't match the
//! order's sell token, or the approved amount exceeds the order's total by
//! `n` or more — the Safe app computes `partSellAmount` as
//! `floor(desired_total / n)`, so up to `n - 1` units of whatever total the
//! user actually approved never show up in `partSellAmount * n`; tolerating
//! exactly that much (and no more) distinguishes this rounding remainder
//! from real over-authorization (the security concern: a compromised
//! relayer could drain the excess) without needing the token's decimals or
//! value to size the tolerance. An approval too small to fully fund the
//! order is a trade-soundness concern, not a security one, and doesn't
//! affect the verdict. Otherwise, the batch is considered secure.
//!
//! **A batched presignature order is checked the same way**
//! ([`CowChecker::check_presignature_batch`]): only an exact
//! 2-call batch — one `approve`, one `setPreSignature`, in either order — is
//! recognized. Unlike the TWAP order's own calldata, a presigned order's
//! terms are signed off-chain, so this fetches the referenced order from
//! CoW's public order-by-UID API and considers the transaction secure once
//! its token/amount exactly match what's approved *and* its proceeds go back
//! to the Safe itself. As with the TWAP check, an insecure verdict here
//! splits by cause: a wrong
//! receiver is [`RuleId::R4_4AuthorizationTarget`] (target manipulation,
//! not an amount concern), while a token/amount mismatch is
//! [`RuleId::R4_5ExcessiveApproval`] — unlike the TWAP check, though, a Safe
//! `approve` sets an allowance rather than incrementing it, so both an
//! under-approval and an over-approval are denied here. An unreachable or
//! malformed API response is `Abstain`, not guessed at either way.

// PoC for F-ENG-037 — the CoW TWAP approval tolerance is sized by an
// attacker-chosen `n`, so a near-unlimited relayer approval is rated `secure`.
//
// HOW TO APPLY: append this whole block, verbatim, to the END of
// `crates/sentinel-engine/src/checkers/cow.rs`. It is a SIBLING of that
// file's `#[cfg(test)] mod tests`, not nested inside it, so it cannot reach
// that module's private helpers (`multisend`, `pack`, `twap_create_data`) —
// they are re-declared here. Constants such as `GP_V2_VAULT_RELAYER` and
// `TWAP_HANDLER` are file-level items of `cow.rs` and DO come through
// `use super::*`.
//
// RUN: cargo test -p sentinel-engine poc_f_eng_037
//
// No HTTP is issued: the presignature path needs a `setPreSignature` call in
// the batch (`cow.rs:283-293`) and this batch has none, so `CowChecker::new()`
// is safe to use offline.
//
// NEVER COMPILED — see this directory's README.md.
