## Claim

The watcher decides when to poll for block `n+1` by taking block `n`'s **chain timestamp**, adding
`block_time` and `block_propagation_delay`, and sleeping until the host's **wall clock** reaches that
value. `Clock::now_ms` is `SystemTime::now`, i.e. a settable, non-monotonic clock; the production
`Clock` keeps no monotonic anchor at all (the `anchor: Instant` field is `#[cfg(test)]` only). The
schedule is therefore only correct while the host clock agrees with chain time.

Two consequences follow, neither of which produces an error, a log line or a metric:

- **A host clock running Δ behind chain time delays every poll by Δ, permanently.** The lag is not
  cumulative but it never recovers either: block `n+1` is fetched Δ after it was available, then
  block `n+2` is fetched Δ after *it* was available, and so on. The service processes every block —
  it never skips — but does so a constant Δ late. On Gnosis (A10: ~5 s blocks, `signing_timeout` 6
  blocks ≈ 30 s, `key_gen_timeout` 120 blocks ≈ 10 min) a skew above about half a minute means the
  validator observes and answers `Sign` messages after the signing window it is being judged on has
  already closed, while every health signal reports normal operation.
- **A backwards clock step of Δ (an NTP correction, a VM resume from a snapshot, a manual clock
  change) makes the very next `sleep_until` compute a deadline Δ further away and sleep for it.**
  `sleep_until` reads `now` once and sleeps `target - now` with `tokio::time::sleep`, so the
  oversized duration is committed even if the clock is corrected a moment later. Indexing stops for
  up to Δ and then resumes with the permanent lag above.

Related, in the same arithmetic: every timestamp expression in the scheduler is unchecked and
operates on an RPC-supplied `u64` (`timestamp * 1000` at `blocks.rs:541`, `427` and `525`;
`timestamp_ms + block_propagation_delay` at `549`; `timestamp_ms += block_time` at `414`). The
workspace defines no `[profile]` section, so release builds have `overflow-checks` off and these
wrap silently, while `cargo test`/debug builds panic. A block header with `timestamp` near
`u64::MAX / 1000` therefore behaves differently in test and in production. Gnosis timestamps are
consensus-constrained, so this is a robustness observation rather than a reachable attack under A4 —
but it is the one place where an RPC-supplied integer feeds unchecked arithmetic on the indexing path.

## Basis

| # | Claim | Class | Citation | Verbatim quote |
| - | ----- | ----- | -------- | -------------- |
| 1 | "Now" is the settable system clock; production keeps no monotonic anchor. | E2 | `crates/core/src/index/clock.rs:31-38` | <pre>/// The current wall-clock time, in Unix epoch milliseconds.<br>#[cfg(not(test))]<br>pub fn now_ms(&self) -> u64 {<br>    SystemTime::now<br>        .duration_since(UNIX_EPOCH)<br>        .unwrap_or_default<br>        .as_millis as u64<br>}</pre> |
| 2 | The only monotonic anchor in the type is test-only, so `Clock::start` is a no-op in production and every call re-reads the wall clock. | E2 | `crates/core/src/index/clock.rs:14-29` | <pre>pub struct Clock {<br>    /// The monotonic instant the clock was started at. "Now" is derived as the<br>    /// time elapsed since this instant added to [`TEST_SYSTEM_TIME_EPOCH_SECONDS`].<br>    #[cfg(test)]<br>    anchor: Instant,<br>}<br><br>impl Clock {<br>    /// Starts a new clock.<br>    pub fn start -> Self {<br>        Self {<br>            #[cfg(test)]<br>            anchor: Instant::now,<br>        }<br>    }</pre> |
| 3 | The sleep duration is computed once from the current wall-clock reading, so a backwards step is committed into the sleep. | E2 | `crates/core/src/index/clock.rs:49-57` | <pre>/// Sleeps until a target Unix epoch time, in milliseconds.<br>///<br>/// If `target` is in the past, returns immediately.<br>pub async fn sleep_until(&self, target: u64) {<br>    let now = self.now_ms;<br>    if target > now {<br>        tokio::time::sleep(Duration::from_millis(target - now)).await;<br>    }<br>}</pre> |
| 4 | The deadline is derived from the previous block's chain timestamp plus the configured block time and propagation delay — the two clocks are compared directly. | E2 | `crates/core/src/index/blocks.rs:537-551` | <pre>/// Updates the pending block to follow the given latest block.<br>fn update_next_pending_block(&mut self, number: u64, timestamp: u64) {<br>    self.pending = PendingBlock {<br>        number: number + 1,<br>        timestamp_ms: timestamp * 1000 + self.block_time,<br>    };<br>}<br>...<br>async fn wait_for_pending_block(&self) {<br>    let target = self.pending.timestamp_ms + self.config.block_propagation_delay;<br>    self.clock.sleep_until(target).await;<br>}</pre> |
| 5 | The comment on the wait acknowledges the "behind the head" case but treats it as a catch-up, not as a persistent skew. | E2 | `crates/core/src/index/blocks.rs:545-548` | <pre>/// Sleeps until the pending block is suspected to be ready. When the watcher<br>/// is behind the head, the pending block's expected time is in the past, so<br>/// this returns immediately and the watcher catches up as fast as it can.</pre> |
| 6 | The reorg-rewind path re-derives the deadline from a chain timestamp the same way, so a skewed clock also slows recovery from a reorg. | E2 | `crates/core/src/index/blocks.rs:425-428` | <pre>self.pending = PendingBlock {<br>    number: last.number,<br>    timestamp_ms: last.timestamp * 1000,<br>};</pre> |
| 7 | The skipped-slot path mutates the deadline with an unchecked add on the same field. | E2 | `crates/core/src/index/blocks.rs:413-415` | <pre>} else {<br>    self.pending.timestamp_ms += self.block_time;<br>}</pre> |
| 8 | Release builds do not check the overflow in basis 4, 6 and 7: there is no `[profile]` in the workspace or in any crate manifest. | E2 | `Cargo.toml:1-3` (whole-file inspection; `grep -n "profile\|overflow" crates/*/Cargo.toml` returns nothing) | <pre>[workspace]<br>resolver = "3"<br>members = ["crates/*"]</pre> |

## Trigger

Skew (the practical case):

1. A validator runs on a host whose clock is Δ = 45 s behind true time — an unsynchronised container,
   a VM whose guest clock drifted, or a host where `chronyd`/`systemd-timesyncd` is not running.
2. Block `n` arrives with chain timestamp `t_n` (which equals true time, since the chain's clock is
   the reference). `update_next_pending_block` sets the next deadline to
   `t_n * 1000 + block_time + block_propagation_delay` ≈ true time of block `n+1` plus 500 ms.
3. `wait_for_pending_block` sleeps until the *host* clock reaches that value, which happens Δ = 45 s
   after block `n+1` was actually produced. Block `n+1` is fetched, and step 2 repeats from `t_{n+1}`.
4. The watcher is now permanently 45 s (nine Gnosis blocks) behind the head. It never skips a block,
   so no `Uncle`, no `ExceededMaxReorgDepth` and no `BadUpdate` is ever raised;
   `safenet_core_block_number{status="processed"}` advances at exactly one block per block time, so a
   rate-based alert sees a healthy service. Only an absolute comparison against the true chain head —
   which nothing in the crate exports — would reveal it.
5. Every deadline the validator is judged on is evaluated against the block number it has reached, so
   `signing_timeout = 6` blocks (≈ 30 s) expires before this validator has even observed the `Sign`
   event. It contributes no share, and the same holds for any other time-boxed ceremony step.

Backwards step (the acute case):

1. A host that has been running with a large forward skew is corrected by NTP, stepping the clock
   back by Δ = 10 minutes (`chronyd` will step rather than slew for corrections above its threshold).
2. The in-flight or next `sleep_until(target)` reads the corrected `now`, computes `target - now`
   ≈ 10 minutes, and sleeps that long (basis 3).
3. Indexing stops for ten minutes with no log and no error, then resumes with the permanent lag of
   the first case.

## Considered and rejected

- **"`tokio::time::sleep` is monotonic, so the clock does not matter."** The *sleep* is monotonic; the
  *duration* is computed from two wall-clock readings (basis 3), so the error is baked in before the
  monotonic timer starts. Making the sleep monotonic is exactly why the oversized duration is honoured
  in full rather than being corrected when the clock is fixed.
- **"The `block_retry_delays` loop compensates."** It compensates for the opposite case. If the host
  clock is *ahead*, `sleep_until` returns immediately, the block is not there yet, and the retry
  delays absorb it (`blocks.rs:392-416`) — that direction is handled. A clock that is *behind* never
  enters the retry loop at all, because by the time it polls, the block is already there.
- **"The watcher would catch up."** The catch-up comment (basis 5) is about a watcher that is behind
  in *block number*; here the watcher is at the right block number relative to its own clock and has
  nothing to catch up to. Each new deadline is re-derived from the newest header's timestamp, so the
  lag is reproduced every block rather than worked off.
- **"Assumption A1 (trusted operator) puts host clock hygiene out of scope."** A1 covers config files,
  the signer key, the SQLite files and the filesystem. It does not assert a synchronised clock, and no
  handbook does either — `grep -rn -i "ntp\|clock\|time sync" docs/` finds no operator requirement.
  This is filed as Low precisely because a well-run host will not hit it.
- **"Chain timestamps could be attacker-controlled to force a long sleep."** Under A4 the RPC is not
  malicious and under A10 the chain is Gnosis, whose consensus rejects headers far in the future, so
  the far-future-timestamp variant is not reachable in this deployment. Recorded as part of the
  unchecked-arithmetic note rather than as a claim.
- **Not a false positive because** every hop — `SystemTime` reading, single-shot duration computation,
  chain-timestamp-derived deadline — is quoted above, and the production `Clock` demonstrably has no
  monotonic state (basis 2).

## Remediation options

1. **Anchor on a monotonic clock and measure the offset once.** Give the production `Clock` the same
   `anchor: Instant` the test variant has, capture `(SystemTime, Instant)` at startup, and derive
   "now" from the monotonic elapsed time. This removes the backwards-step stall entirely and leaves
   only a fixed startup offset. Tradeoff: none of substance; it also makes the production and test
   implementations structurally identical, which is a testability win.
2. **Schedule relative to observation, not to the chain clock.** Sleep
   `block_time - (elapsed since the previous block was *observed*)` using a monotonic instant, and use
   the chain timestamp only to detect a skipped slot. This makes the schedule independent of host/chain
   clock agreement in both directions. Tradeoff: slightly worse behaviour when the watcher is
   deliberately catching up over a backlog, which the existing `sleep_until`-in-the-past shortcut
   handles for free; keep that shortcut.
3. **Cap the sleep.** Whatever else is done, clamp `sleep_until` to at most a small multiple of
   `block_time`, so no single scheduling decision can stop indexing for minutes.
4. **Make skew observable.** Export `safenet_core_head_lag_seconds` (host time minus the timestamp of
   the block just processed) or an explicit "chain head vs processed block" gauge, and log a `warn`
   once when the deadline computed for a block is more than one `block_time` away from the observed
   arrival. Without this, neither of the two cases in the Trigger is detectable from the outside.
5. **Use checked or saturating arithmetic** for the five timestamp expressions (basis 4, 6, 7), or set
   `overflow-checks = true` on the release profile, so debug and release agree.

Tests to add:
- `clock.rs`: a test that steps the underlying clock backwards between `start` and `sleep_until`
  and asserts the sleep is bounded. (Requires option 1 or 3 to be implementable at all — under the
  current design the assertion cannot be written, which is itself the point.)
- `blocks.rs`: drive `next` with a clock offset from the block timestamps and assert the observed
  per-block latency does not grow with the offset.

## Trail

- Reviewer R1: drafted from lead CORE-H13 (analysis confidence 50%). Re-read `clock.rs` in
  full and confirmed the production variant has no monotonic state, which the analysis did not state.
  The permanent-lag argument (as distinct from a one-off delay) was derived here and is the reason the
  finding is worth filing: the failure is silent and steady-state rather than transient. Kept at Low
  because it requires a mismanaged host clock. Self-estimate 75% for the mechanism, 35% that a
  production deployment is affected. No `E1`: read-only run.

## Critic (C-CORE-A)

### Per-claim verdicts — all Supported

- `clock.rs:31-38`: the production `now_ms` is `SystemTime::now.duration_since(UNIX_EPOCH)
  .unwrap_or_default.as_millis as u64`. The `anchor: Instant` field is `#[cfg(test)]` only
  (`clock.rs:18-20`), so the production clock keeps **no monotonic reference at all** — verified.
- `clock.rs:52-57`: `sleep_until` reads `now` once and sleeps `target - now`. `tokio::time::sleep`
  is monotonic-based, so a clock correction after the read cannot shorten the sleep. The
  backwards-step case is exact.
- `blocks.rs:538-543` and `:548-551`: the deadline is `block.timestamp * 1000 + block_time +
  block_propagation_delay`, i.e. **chain** time, compared against **host** time. The skew claim
  follows directly.
- I re-derived the "permanent, non-cumulative" property independently: with a host clock Δ behind
  true time, the host reaches deadline `V` at true time `V + Δ`, so block `n+1` is fetched
  Δ + `block_propagation_delay` after it was produced, and the next deadline is recomputed from
  `t_{n+1}` — a constant lag that never grows and never recovers. The reviewer's characterisation is
  correct.
- The overflow note is verified: `grep -n "profile\|overflow" Cargo.toml crates/*/Cargo.toml` returns
  nothing, so the workspace defines no `[profile]` section and release builds inherit
  `overflow-checks = false` while test/debug builds panic. Correctly filed as a robustness note
  rather than a reachable attack under A4.

### Finding verdict

**Confirmed** — the mechanism follows directly from the quoted code with no unproven step; the
"trigger" is a host state (an unsynchronised clock), not an event that has to occur.
**Certainty 70%.** At the bottom of the Confirmed band because the *consequence* the finding leans on
— missing a `signing_timeout` window at Δ ≈ 45 s (A10: 6 blocks ≈ 30 s) — is an inference about the
validator's ceremony deadlines rather than something traced in this file, and the size of Δ in any
real deployment is unknown.
**Severity Low, unchanged.** Under A1 the host is provisioned by an honest operator and the fix is
NTP, so this is a robustness and observability weakness rather than a defect an adversary reaches.
It is nonetheless worth acting on for one reason the finding states well: **there is no signal**. The
service processes every block, `safenet_core_block_number{status="processed"}` advances at exactly
one block per block time, and nothing in the crate exports the *absolute* distance to the chain head,
so no rate-based alert can see it. A head-lag gauge is the cheap fix and should be in the
remediation regardless of the clock question.

## QA (QA-CORE-SEN)

**Outcome: Not attempted (no toolchain).** No Rust toolchain exists on this host (`state/baseline.md` §1), so nothing was executed and no certainty moves. No PoC was written for this finding; the seven PoCs this run produced are in `rust-audit/poc/` for F-CORE-001, -002, -060, -067 and F-SEN-001, -002, -015. This section is a remediation-soundness check only.

### Remediation check

**Sound: option 1, and it is close to free.**

Option 1 (anchor on a monotonic clock, capture `(SystemTime, Instant)` once at startup) removes the
backwards-step stall entirely, leaves only a fixed startup offset, and — as the finding notes — makes
the production and test `Clock` structurally identical, which is a real testability gain rather than
a rhetorical one. Its "tradeoff: none of substance" is accurate.

Option 2 (schedule relative to observation) is also sound and is strictly more robust, but its own
caveat matters: the `sleep_until`-in-the-past shortcut must be kept, or catching up over a backlog
gets worse. Option 1 is the better first change.

Option 3 (clamp the sleep to a small multiple of `block_time`) is a one-line defensive bound and
should be taken whichever of 1 or 2 is chosen — it is the only part that limits the damage of a
scheduling bug nobody anticipated.

Option 4 (`head_lag_seconds`) is necessary: as shipped, neither Trigger case is detectable from
outside the process.

Option 5 (checked/saturating arithmetic on the five timestamp expressions, or `overflow-checks =
true`) is sound; note that setting `overflow-checks` on the release profile is a workspace-wide
change that interacts with F-XC-001's profile findings and should be decided there, not here.
