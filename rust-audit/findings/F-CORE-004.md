## Claim

Every failure inside the event watcher leaves the watcher on the same step, and the driver retries
that step unconditionally every 100 ms with no backoff and no bound. There is no state in which the
indexer gives up, escalates, changes strategy in a way that could succeed, or marks itself unhealthy.
That is a reasonable policy for *transient* failures, but the watcher applies it identically to
failures that are pure, deterministic functions of chain content, where every retry is guaranteed to
produce the same error.

The sharpest instance is `decode_and_sort`. A log is selected by the `eth_getLogs` filter on
`(watched address) × (watched topic0)` alone; if the ABI decode of that log then fails —
because the log's topic count or payload does not match the event whose signature hash it carries —
`decode_and_sort` returns `Error::DecodeLog` for the whole batch. The block is retried forever, the
chain cursor freezes at that block, `safenet_core_block_number{status="processed"}` stops advancing,
and `/health` keeps answering `OK` because the exporter is a liveness probe with no link to the
driver (`observability/metrics.rs:9-10`). The only signal is a `warn` line repeating ten times a
second.

Under assumption A2 the emitters of watched events are attacker-controlled within the fault bound,
and the validator additionally watches operator-configured third-party oracle contracts whose results
— not whose event stream — are what the operator is trusting
(`crates/validator/src/main.rs:56-57`, `crates/validator/src/config.rs:66-69`). One `LOG1` with
topic0 set to a watched event's signature hash and no further topics is therefore enough to stop
indexing permanently in every validator configured with that oracle. Because the input is a chain
log, the effect is deterministic and simultaneous across all of them, which turns a single cheap
transaction into a network-wide liveness failure rather than a single-node one.

Three further error classes reach the same infinite loop with no fallback:

- `Error::TooManyLogs` (`events.rs:471-486`) when a block genuinely contains at least
  `max_logs_per_query` watched logs — deterministic, and reachable by an attacker who can emit that
  many watched events in one block.
- A warp page that keeps failing: the page size halves to one and then stays there, which the code
  comments call out as intentional ("single-block pages are retried indefinitely",
  `events.rs:339-340`). Unlike the new-block path there is no strategy escalation at all past
  page size one.
- A `-32001` "resource not found" during a warp, or once `recent` has been unwound: 
  `revalidate_last_block` returns `Ok(None)` (`blocks.rs:486-501`), so `Watcher::next_logs`
  re-raises the original error (`index/mod.rs:124-125`) and the loop repeats.

| 8 | The driver retries every watcher error except the deep-reorg one, forever, at a fixed 100 ms, with a `warn` and no metric.

## Trigger

Primary trigger (`DecodeLog`, deterministic, network-wide):

1. A validator is configured with `oracles = ["0xORACLE"]`, so `0xORACLE` is in the `eth_getLogs`
   address list alongside the `Consensus` and `FROSTCoordinator` contracts (basis 9).
2. `0xORACLE` — or anything that can cause it to emit, under assumption A2 — emits a log with
   `topics = [keccak256("Sign(address,bytes32,bytes32,bytes32,uint64)")]` and arbitrary `data`,
   i.e. a single-topic `LOG1` carrying a watched event's signature hash but *not* the event's three
   indexed parameters (`crates/validator/src/bindings.rs:200-206` declares
   `Sign(address indexed initiator, bytes32 indexed gid, bytes32 indexed message, bytes32 sid,
   uint64 sequence)`, so a valid log has four topics and this one has one). Any watched selector
   works; `Sign` is used here because it is one of the `FROSTCoordinator` selectors in
   `E::topics`.
3. The block containing that log is emitted as `New { n, .. }`. `EventWatcher::block` issues the
   filtered query; the node correctly returns the log, because it matches address ∈ watched and
   topic0 ∈ watched.
4. `decode_and_sort` calls `E::decode_log`. `Consensus::ConsensusEvents::decode_raw_log` fails
   (wrong selector), `Coordinator::CoordinatorEvents::decode_raw_log` fails (topic count does not
   match the indexed arity of `Sign`), `Oracle::OracleEvents::decode_raw_log` fails. `decode_log`
   returns `None`, so the whole batch becomes `Err(Error::DecodeLog { .. })` (basis 1, 2).
5. `EventWatcher::block` keeps `Step::Block { block_number: n, retries: retries + 1 }` (basis 3).
   The driver logs a `warn`, sleeps 100 ms, and calls `Watcher::next` again (basis 8).
6. From attempt `block_single_query_retry_count` onwards the strategy switches to `MultipleQueries`,
   which issues the same per-topic filters and returns the same log, so the same `DecodeLog` recurs.
   There is no further strategy and no give-up.
7. The validator is now permanently stuck on block `n`: no further events are processed, no ceremony
   messages are seen, no attestations are produced, ten RPC calls per second are burned, and both
   `/health` and the process exit status report success. Every validator that lists the same oracle
   stalls at the same block.

Secondary triggers, same loop, no attacker required:

- A node that persistently answers `-32001` for a range query during the post-restart warp (for
  example an endpoint that has pruned that history): basis 6 and 7 route it to an unbounded retry
  that never reaches `blocks.next` and therefore never surfaces as a block-watcher error.
- With `max_logs_per_query` configured, one block that legitimately contains at least that many
  watched logs: `TooManyLogs` on every attempt with page size already at one (basis 4, 5).

## Considered and rejected

- **"The strategy escalation eventually resolves it."** The escalation is single-step and only
  changes *how the node filters*, never *what happens to an undecodable log*:
  `SingleQuery`/`ClientFiltered` → `MultipleQueries` (`events.rs:369-380`), then nothing. All three
  paths end in the same `decode_and_sort` call (`events.rs:468`).
- **"`fallible_events` covers this."** It does not. It drops the result of a failed *query* for a
  configured topic (`events.rs:426-436`), not a decode failure: `decode_and_sort` runs after the
  per-topic error handling and is outside the `try_join_all` closure. It also has no production
  user — `grep -rn "fallible_events" crates/` matches only `core/src/index/events.rs` (definition,
  default and tests) and one test in `core/src/index/mod.rs:220`; no service crate sets it.
- **"The topic0 collision is theoretical."** The crate's own test fixture demonstrates the collision
  class: `Erc20::Transfer` and `Erc721::Transfer` share a signature hash, and
  `decodes_and_sorts_mixed_logs` asserts that decoding an ERC-721 `Transfer` as `Erc20Events` yields
  exactly `Err(Error::DecodeLog { log_index: 1 })` (`events.rs:750-753`). The deliberate `LOG1`
  variant in the trigger does not even need a collision — it needs one `log1` opcode.
- **"The state machine or the driver would notice and exit."** Neither sees the error: the retry loop
  in `next_input` swallows everything except `ExceededMaxReorgDepth` (basis 8), so the state machine
  is never called and the fail-stop policy never engages.
- **"A metric or health check would page an operator."** `safenet_core_block_number{status=processed}`
  simply stops moving (`crates/core/src/metrics.rs:62-70`); there is no "indexer stalled" gauge, no
  error counter, no consecutive-failure counter, and `/health` is unconditional (basis 11). Detection
  requires the operator to have written a rate/staleness alert on that gauge themselves; nothing in
  `docs/validator-handbook.md` tells them to.
- **"Is this the same as F-CORE-005 or F-CORE-006?"** No. F-CORE-005 is a narrower configuration
  case of the same loop (`max_reorg_depth = 0`) and F-CORE-006 is about a *decodable* log from the
  wrong emitter being accepted. This finding is about an *undecodable* log being fatal-but-silent.
  The per-address topic-set remediation in F-CORE-006 would also fix the attacker-controlled variant
  here, which is why they should be read together; the non-attacker variants (basis 4-7) would not be
  fixed by it.
- **Not a false positive because** each element (unbounded retry, no terminal state, decode failure
  aborting the batch, watched third-party addresses) is quoted from this checkout, and the crate's own
  test pins the decode-failure behaviour.

## Remediation options

1. **Classify errors and stop retrying the deterministic ones.** Split `index::Error` into transient
   (transport, timeout, rate limit) and permanent (`DecodeLog`, `TooManyLogs` at page size one,
   `IncompleteLogs` after the budget). Permanent errors should propagate out of `Driver::next_input`
   exactly as `ExceededMaxReorgDepth` does, so the fail-stop policy that already exists is used.
   Tradeoff: a fail-stop turns a stall into an exit, which is only an improvement if the exit is
   visible — pair it with a non-zero exit code and an unhealthy `/health` (owned by R2).
2. **Do not let one bad log poison a whole block.** Skip logs that match the filter but fail to
   decode, count them in a `safenet_core_undecodable_logs_total{address}` counter, and continue.
   Tradeoff: this trades a stall for silent omission, so it must be paired with the per-address topic
   sets of F-CORE-006 — otherwise a watched-but-unauthorised address can suppress nothing but also
   goes unnoticed. It is the right default because a log that fails to decode *cannot* be a valid
   protocol message.
3. **Bound and back off.** Give `Step::Block` and `Step::Warping` a maximum attempt count and
   exponential backoff, and expose `safenet_core_index_consecutive_failures` plus a "stalled" state
   in `/health` after N consecutive failures on the same step. This does not fix the stall but makes
   it loud, and is the minimum that should ship even if option 1 or 2 is deferred.
4. Reduce the attack surface independently: restrict oracle addresses to the `Oracle` event set only
   (see F-CORE-006), which removes the third-party emitter from the `Coordinator`/`Consensus` topic
   filters entirely.

Tests to add:
- `events.rs`: `fetch_logs` over a log whose topic0 is a watched selector but whose topic count is
  wrong; assert the chosen policy (error classified as permanent, or the log skipped and counted).
- `events.rs`: drive `EventWatcher::next` on the same `Step::Block` twenty times with a
  `DecodeLog`-producing response and assert the watcher does not stay in the same state forever.
- `index/mod.rs`: a `-32001` during a `Warp` step; assert it is not retried indefinitely.

## Trail

- Reviewer R1: drafted from lead CORE-H8 plus Manager lead M9 (the driver-side retry is
  cited as context only; the driver finding belongs to R2). Every citation re-opened at commit
  `2893917`. Raised above the analysis' Medium because the `DecodeLog` variant is reachable from a
  single attacker-emitted log at an address the operator was told to trust only for results, and its
  effect is deterministic across every validator watching that oracle — the definition of a liveness
  failure "under attacker-controlled input" in the severity scale. Self-estimate 80% for the
  mechanism, 65% that the oracle-emitter variant is reachable in a live deployment (it needs at least
  one configured oracle whose event stream an attacker can influence). No `E1`: read-only run.

## Critic (C-CORE-A)

Method note: I derived the error taxonomy of `events.rs:356-398`, `489-519` and `index/mod.rs:106-130`
before reading the Claim, and independently reached the "no terminal state" conclusion. Where I part
company with the reviewer is on which trigger carries the finding.

### Per-claim verdicts

All basis rows re-opened are **Supported** as quotations. In particular:

- `decode_and_sort` (`events.rs:491-519`) returns `Err(Error::DecodeLog { .. })` for the **whole
  batch** when `E::decode_log` yields `None` for any single log — verified; the `?` on
  `collect::<Result<Vec<_>, _>>` aborts the batch.
- `block` (`events.rs:382-392`) stores `retries + 1` and keeps `Step::Block` on every error, with
  no give-up branch; `warp` (`events.rs:337-348`) halves the page size to a floor of one and the
  comment at `:338-340` says so explicitly.
- `driver.rs:206-231` retries everything except `ExceededMaxReorgDepth`, with a flat
  `STEP_RETRY_DELAY` and no backoff or bound.
- `observability/metrics.rs:9-10` re-read verbatim: "The listener serves Prometheus-formatted metrics
  on every path except `/health`, which returns a plain `OK` for liveness probes." There is no link
  to driver progress, so the `/health`-stays-green claim is exact.
- `main.rs:56-57` and `config.rs:66-69` are quoted correctly.

### Where I disagree: the trigger that justifies High is not established

The primary trigger requires a contract at a watched address to emit a raw `LOG1` carrying a watched
selector. The three watched address classes are `consensus`, `coordinator` (read from
`Consensus.getCoordinator`, `main.rs:49-52`) and `config.validator.oracles`. The first two are the
audited Solidity in `contracts/src`, whose `emit` statements always produce a well-formed log, so the
only candidate is an oracle contract — and `contracts/src` ships three implementations
(`SentinelOracle.sol`, `SimpleOracle.sol`, `AlwaysApproveOracle.sol`) none of which can. R6 checked
this mechanically for the neighbouring finding and recorded the result in **F-VAL-060**: no `topic0`
collisions across all 18 event definitions, and the reference oracles cannot emit a colliding
selector. R6 rated the precondition — an *injectable* watched oracle address — at about 25%.

So the primary trigger is not "attacker-reachable given A2"; it is reachable given A2 **plus** a
third-party, upgradeable or later-compromised oracle in the operator's allow-list. I looked for a
route that does not need that precondition and found none: `Consensus.TransactionProposed` carries
attacker-controlled `bytes` (A2) but is ABI-encoded by Solidity and decodes cleanly, and the
`log.block_number` / `log.log_index` `None` route (`events.rs:501-502`) needs a node that omits
fields for a mined block, which A4 does not admit.

### What does carry the finding

The **secondary** trigger needs no attacker at all and I verified it end to end: a persistent
`-32001` on a *range* query during the post-restart warp. `revalidate_last_block` returns `Ok(None)`
before doing anything, because `queue.front` is the first queued `New` (`blocks.rs:486-490`,
`:494-497`) and every header in `recent` has a number `>=` that, so `rposition` finds nothing;
`next_logs` re-raises (`index/mod.rs:124-125`); the driver retries every 100 ms forever. Generalising:
**any persistent error during a warp or a block fetch produces an unbounded, unescalating retry loop
in which `/health` answers `OK`, no metric moves and the only trace is a `warn` ten times a second.**
That is the real defect, it is reachable under A4 alone, and it is what the remediation should
target.

### Finding verdict

**Confirmed** — the mechanism (no terminal error state, no escalation, no health linkage) is verified,
and at least one trigger (persistent RPC error during warp or block fetch) is verified without any
adversarial precondition.
**Certainty 75%.**
**Severity corrected: High → Medium.** High on this system's scale requires liveness loss "under
attacker-controlled input or reorgs within `max_reorg_depth`". The attacker-controlled variant is the
`DecodeLog` one, and its precondition is unproven (see above, and F-VAL-060). What remains is
"incorrect behaviour under unusual but reachable conditions" with an unbounded stall and a green
health check — Medium. **If QA or the team establish that any address in `config.validator.oracles`
is a third-party or upgradeable contract in the intended deployment, this returns to High
immediately**, because the network-wide simultaneity argument the reviewer makes is correct: the
input is a chain log, so every validator watching that oracle stalls on the same block. I have
recorded that as the escalation condition rather than assuming it either way.

**Relationship to F-VAL-060 and F-CORE-006:** all three share the "watched address set is broader
than the trusted contract set" root cause. F-VAL-060 should be canonical for the *consequence* of an
injectable oracle; this finding should be canonical for the *absence of a terminal error state*,
which is a separate defect that outlives any fix to the address set.

## QA (QA-CORE-SEN)

**Outcome: Not attempted (no toolchain).** No Rust toolchain exists on this host (`state/baseline.md` §1), so nothing was executed and no certainty moves. No PoC was written for this finding; the seven PoCs this run produced are in `rust-audit/poc/` for F-CORE-001, -002, -060, -067 and F-SEN-001, -002, -015. This section is a remediation-soundness check only.

### Remediation check

**Sound: option 1 plus option 3. Option 2 conflicts with F-CORE-002 and needs a stated boundary.**

Option 1 (classify errors; propagate the deterministic ones as `ExceededMaxReorgDepth` already is) is
the correct direction and reuses a fail-stop policy that exists. Its stated dependency is real and
load-bearing: a fail-stop is only an improvement if the exit is visible, and today
`Driver::run` discards its outcome so the process exits with status **0** (F-CORE-030). **Option 1
depends on F-CORE-030 landing first.**

Option 3 (bounded attempts, `consecutive_failures` metric, a stalled state in `/health`) is the
minimum that should ship even if everything else is deferred, and it is a prerequisite for
**F-CORE-002 option 1**, which deliberately converts silent log loss into a stall. Without option 3
that fix trades one invisible failure for another.

**Option 2 (skip undecodable logs and continue) conflicts with F-CORE-002 option 1 and must not be
adopted without a written boundary.** Both are in `safenet-core`, on the same fetch-and-decode path.
Taken together the policy becomes "verify the log set is complete, then silently discard members of
it". F-SEN-013 option 2 proposes the same skip. Since this finding is canonical for the
retry-forever mechanism, the boundary belongs here: skipping is defensible **only** for a log that
cannot be a valid protocol message (a decode failure at a watched address), **only** paired with
F-CORE-006's per-address topic sets so an unauthorised emitter cannot manufacture the condition, and
**never** in a way that lets an empty or short result pass a completeness gate. Its own text half
says this ("must be paired with the per-address topic sets of F-CORE-006"); it needs to say the
F-CORE-002 half too.

Option 4 (restrict oracle addresses to the `Oracle` event set) is sound and orthogonal, and is the
only option that shrinks the attack surface rather than handling the consequence.
