## Claim

Nonce allocation takes `MAX(chain_nonce, MAX(allocated_nonce) + 1)`. The `MAX(nonce)+1` term is a monotone high-water mark over the whole table: once any row has been given nonce *N*, every future row gets a nonce above *N*, for as long as that row exists. And the row exists forever — pruning deletes only rows that are marked executed or that are still unallocated and expired, so a row holding a nonce it can never get included on is deleted by nothing.

If the chain nonce is ever observed **above** the true canonical value even once, the queue allocates into a gap the canonical chain will never fill. That row can never be included; it is never dropped; the high-water mark keeps every subsequent action above it, so nothing else can be included either; `count_in_flight` counts it forever, so after `max_in_flight_transactions` (default 16) such rows accumulate the queue stops allocating altogether. There is no consistency check anywhere (`chain_nonce <= MAX(nonce)+1` is never asserted), no error is raised, no metric moves, and the only symptom is repeated `warn` lines. The service is silently and permanently unable to act onchain, and restarting does not help because the state is in SQLite.

Under A4 the RPC may be "inconsistent between calls". The queue accepts whatever `eth_getTransactionCount` returns and writes it into durable, irreversible state.

| 3 | Pruning removes only executed rows and unallocated expired rows. A row with a nonce and `executed_at IS NULL` matches neither `DELETE`. | E2 | `crates/core/src/tx/storage.rs:249-265` | <pre>// Prune transactions executed at or below the reorg-safe block.<br>sqlx::query("DELETE FROM transactions WHERE executed_at IS NOT NULL AND executed_at <= ?")<br>    .bind(safe)<br>    .execute(&mut *tx)<br>    .await?;<br><br>// Remove queued (not-yet-submitted) transactions that expired at or<br>// before the reorg-safe block.

| 6 | The only mechanism that clears an execution marker is a *block-number* regression; nothing releases an allocated nonce, and nothing reacts to the chain nonce moving down. | E2 | `crates/core/src/tx/mod.rs:166-179` | <pre>// Invalidate execution markers for transactions as necessary.<br>if let Some(block) = match previous {<br>    // On startup, conservatively invalidate all transactions executed<br>    // past the `safe` block, as there may have been reorgs.<br>    None => status.safe.checked_add(1),<br>    // In case of a reorg (where the status has a latest block before<br>    // the last status we've seen) indicates a reorg to `latest`, so<br>    // invalidate markers accordingly.<br>    Some(previous) if previous.latest > status.latest => status.latest.checked_add(1),<br>    // In all other cases, there are no markers to invalidate.<br>    _ => None,<br>} {<br>    self.storage.unmark_executed(block).await?;<br>}</pre> |

## Trigger

A single observation of `eth_getTransactionCount(signer, block_status.latest)` above the canonical value, at a moment when the queue has a transaction to allocate.

The clean instance under A4 is a load-balanced provider. The block watcher and the queue share one `Provider` and one URL (`crates/core/src/driver.rs:247` passes the watcher's own `block_status` into the queue), but a load balancer can route the header stream and the nonce query to different backends. If the backend answering the nonce query is at the same height on a *different* fork in which the signer sent a transaction that the canonical chain does not contain, it returns a count one higher than canonical. Concretely: canonical count is 5; backend Y reports 6; the queue allocates nonce 6 to a transaction. Nonce 5 is now a gap that only the signer can fill, and the queue will never fill it because claim 1 floors every future allocation at 7. Nonce 6 sits in the node's queued pool indefinitely. Claim 3 shows it is never deleted; claim 6 shows nothing unwinds it (the block height never regressed, so `unmark_executed` does not fire, and even if it did it clears `executed_at`, not `nonce`); claim 7 shows it is rebroadcast forever, which via `F-CORE-060` also ratchets its fee 10% per block. After 16 further actions the queue is fully wedged (claims 4, 5) and the service is inert onchain for the remainder of the deployment, across restarts, until an operator manually edits the SQLite file or sends a filler transaction from the signing key by hand.

A second instance needs no forked view at all: an external transaction from the same key consumes nonces 5–19 (raising the observed count to 20), the queue allocates 20, and those external transactions are then reorged out. The canonical count returns to 5, nonces 6–19 are unallocated by anyone, and nonce 20 is wedged exactly as above. This is inside A5 if the reorg is shallower than `max_reorg_depth`, and the operator handbook's "do not reuse the key" guidance is the only thing standing in its way — while `crates/core/src/tx/storage.rs:126-130` (claim 8) documents external use as *supported*.

I cannot demonstrate either instance offline (no toolchain, no network), so the trigger is class `I`. Claims 1–9 — that the allocation floor is monotone, that such a row is never released, that it consumes an in-flight slot forever, that no check exists — are `E2` and are the substance of the finding: **there is no recovery path from a nonce gap by any route, whatever produces it.**

## Considered and rejected

- **"Two live rows could end up with the same nonce, so this is really a duplicate-nonce bug."** Rejected, and worth stating because it constrains the finding. Whenever the passed chain nonce is at or below an existing allocated nonce, `MAX(nonce)+1` strictly exceeds every existing nonce and wins; whenever it is above, it is above all of them. So no two *live* rows can share a nonce (`crates/core/src/tx/storage.rs:145-149`). The collision that matters here is with a *pruned* row, i.e. with history, and history is exactly what the table no longer holds.
- **"Pinning the nonce query to `block_status.latest` prevents this."** It prevents the *lagging* case, which is why this finding is scoped to inconsistent rather than merely stale views. A backend that has not imported `block_status.latest` must answer `eth_getTransactionCount` for an unknown header with an error, and an error is classified intermittent (`crates/core/src/tx/mod.rs:47-54`) and retried next block. A backend at the same height on a different fork answers successfully with a different number, and nothing distinguishes it.
- **"`mark_executed` will clean the gap up."** It marks rows *below* the chain nonce (`crates/core/src/tx/storage.rs:224-235`). The wedged row is at or above the chain nonce by construction, so it is never marked, never pruned, and never released. `mark_executed` is what cleans up the opposite error (a nonce allocated too *low*) — which is `F-CORE-063`, and it does so by silently discarding the action.
- **"`unmark_executed` restores the queue after a reorg."** It restores execution *markers* (`crates/core/src/tx/storage.rs:271-279`), setting `executed_at = NULL`. It does not set `nonce = NULL`, so it can return a row to the in-flight set but can never return it to the queued set. There is no code anywhere in the crate that writes `nonce = NULL`; grep over `storage.rs` finds `nonce` written only by the allocation statement at line 146.
- **"`expires_at` eventually drops it."** No — see claim 3 and `F-CORE-064`. Expiry is checked only for `nonce IS NULL` rows.
- **"The process would crash or exit and an orchestrator would restart it."** Nothing errors. `Error::Rpc` is intermittent and swallowed by the driver (`crates/core/src/driver.rs:247-253`); the rejections from the wedged rows are `warn` lines (`crates/core/src/tx/mod.rs:288`); the `/health` endpoint is liveness-only. A restart re-reads the same SQLite rows and resumes the wedge.
- **"The existing tests cover reconciliation, so this would have been caught."** The reconciliation tests (`crates/core/src/tx/mod.rs:457-538`) only ever feed nonces that move forward or stay put, and `analysis-core.md` §10 lists "`mark_executed` with nonces consumed externally" among the untested paths. No test drives the chain nonce above the queue's own allocations.

## Remediation options

1. **Assert the invariant and fail loudly.** Before allocating, check `status.nonce <= COALESCE(MAX(nonce), status.nonce) + 1`. A chain nonce further ahead than the queue's own high-water mark means the queue's view and the chain's have diverged; that is not a condition to write durable state from. Return a distinct, *non*-intermittent error so the driver exits (`crates/core/src/tx/mod.rs:47-54`) rather than silently proceeding. Tradeoff: this makes a transiently inconsistent provider fatal, so it should be paired with a bounded retry before the error escalates. It also legitimately fires when an external sender uses the key, which claim 8 says is supported — so the check must be a configurable policy, not an unconditional abort.
2. **Make a wedge observable.** Export gauges for in-flight count, oldest unexecuted nonce, blocks since that nonce was allocated, and current `max_priority_fee_per_gas`. This does not prevent the wedge but converts an invisible, permanent outage into an alertable one, and it is the cheapest change here. It also covers `F-CORE-060` and `F-CORE-061`.
3. **Add a release path.** Give an in-flight row a way back to the queued set: after K blocks without inclusion and without the chain nonce reaching it, clear its `nonce` (and its recorded fees) so it is re-allocated from the current chain nonce. Correctness rests on the earlier broadcast being unable to land, so it must only fire when the chain nonce is *below* the row's nonce and the row has never been accepted into a mempool — otherwise it risks a duplicate. This is the only option that recovers an already-wedged deployment automatically.
4. **Fill the gap deliberately.** When the chain nonce is below `MIN(allocated nonce)`, submit a self-transfer of zero value for each missing nonce to unblock the queue. Costs gas and is crude, but it is the standard operational remedy and encoding it removes the need for manual SQLite surgery.
5. **Add `UNIQUE(nonce)` plus indexes on `nonce` and `executed_at`.** Does not fix this, but it turns any future allocation bug into a loud database error instead of silent divergence, and every query in `storage.rs` is currently a full scan (claim 9).
6. **Document the operator recovery procedure.** Right now there is none. At minimum: how to tell a wedged queue from an idle one, and what to do about it.

Tests to add: a storage test that allocates a nonce, then calls `next_transaction` with a `status.nonce` *above* the high-water mark and asserts the intended policy (error, or a recorded gap); a queue test that drives the mocked transaction count forward by 2 while only one nonce was allocated and asserts what happens next; and a test that a row which never executes is eventually either released or reported, rather than resubmitted forever.

## Trail

- Reviewer R3: drafted, self-estimate 55%. The structural claims (monotone floor, no release path, permanent in-flight occupancy, no check, no signal) are `E2` and, I believe, not seriously contestable. The estimate is held at 55% because every route I could find to the initial bad observation requires an RPC inconsistency or external key use that I cannot demonstrate in this run. If the Critic finds a route that needs neither, this should rise substantially; it splits the `analysis-core.md` H11 lead (35%), whose "permanent gap" half I judge more severe than its "dropped action" half (`F-CORE-063`) because it has no self-healing behaviour at all.

## Critic (C-CORE-B)

I worked the allocation SQL out for myself first. `next_transaction` sets `nonce = MAX(?1, COALESCE((SELECT MAX(nonce) + 1 FROM transactions), 0))` where `?1` is the chain nonce, over a `WHERE id = (… nonce IS NULL AND (expires_at IS NULL OR expires_at > ?2) ORDER BY id ASC LIMIT 1)` (`tx/storage.rs:144-161`). The `MAX(nonce)+1` term is a table-wide high-water mark; the aggregate ignores `NULL`s, so an empty or all-unallocated table falls back to the chain nonce, and every later allocation is strictly above every existing one. Nothing anywhere writes `nonce = NULL`. That is the finding's spine and it is correct.

### Per-claim verdicts

Rows 1-9 all **Supported**, verbatim at the cited ranges. Row 9's "no `UNIQUE` constraint and no index" is confirmed from the `CREATE TABLE` at `tx/storage.rs:69-80`: the only key is `id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY`. Nothing is `H`.

### Verification of the refuted negative — "two live rows could share a nonce"

The brief asked me to check this as carefully as the positives, because the queue's whole safety argument leans on it. I re-derived it independently and **the refutation is sound**:

- Case `chain_nonce <= MAX(nonce)`: `MAX(nonce)+1 > chain_nonce`, so the allocation is `MAX(nonce)+1`, strictly above every live nonce.
- Case `chain_nonce > MAX(nonce)`: the allocation is `chain_nonce`, also strictly above every live nonce.
- Empty/all-`NULL` table: the SQL aggregate `MAX(nonce)` is `NULL`, `NULL + 1` is `NULL`, `COALESCE(…, 0)` yields 0, so the allocation is the chain nonce. No collision with anything, because nothing is allocated.
- The one case the reviewer flags — collision with a **pruned** row — I also checked and it cannot happen either: a row is pruned only when `executed_at IS NOT NULL AND executed_at <= safe` (`tx/storage.rs:250`), `executed_at` is written only when the chain nonce had already moved past that row's nonce (`:224-235`), and account nonces are monotone on the canonical chain within A5's reorg bound, so the chain nonce read at `block_status.latest >= safe >= executed_at` is strictly above every pruned nonce. Allocation is therefore always above history as well as above the live set.
- Single-writer is also established: every `TransactionQueue` method takes `&mut self` and the driver owns it by value on one task, and the allocation is one atomic `UPDATE … RETURNING`.

So `record_submission`'s `WHERE nonce = ?` really does touch at most one row, and duplicate live nonces are correctly ruled out. The reviewer's log entry 5 stands.

### Where I differ

Two things pull this below the reviewer's framing.

1. **The trigger is `I`, and the reviewer says so — but the High rating was set as if it were not.** The clean instance needs an `eth_getTransactionCount` above canonical at a block height the block watcher agrees with. A4 admits a **stale, rate-limited or incomplete** provider; it does not explicitly admit a *fork-inconsistent* one, and an actively lying RPC is out of scope. A load-balanced backend answering from a same-height sibling fork sits in the gap between those, which is a defensible reading but not a settled one. The second instance (external transactions from the same key, then reorged out) needs no RPC anomaly and is inside A5, but it needs key reuse that the handbook advises against — while `tx/storage.rs:126-130` does document external use as supported, which is the tension the reviewer correctly identifies.
2. **The `E2` core of the finding is not the trigger at all.** It is: *there is no release path from an allocated nonce, by any route, whatever produced it.* That property is fully verified, is independent of any provider behaviour, and is the thing worth fixing. The finding would be stronger titled that way.

### Finding verdict

**Plausible — 60%.** Mechanism `E2` and airtight; trigger `I` on both instances. The 40-69 band per the rubric.

**Severity: High → Medium (corrected).** PROMPT.md §8's High band is "an honest validator or sentinel loses liveness … **under attacker-controlled input or reorgs within `max_reorg_depth`**". No attacker steers either instance here: instance 1 needs a provider misconfiguration, instance 2 needs operator key reuse plus a reorg. The *outcome* is as bad as High implies — permanent, silent, survives restarts — but the reachability is not, and by the brief's own instruction ("a panic that no untrusted input can reach is Low or Informational however alarming it looks") the rating must follow reachability. Medium: "incorrect behaviour under unusual but reachable conditions" with an unrecoverable rather than recoverable end state.

Remediation 2 (gauges for in-flight count, oldest unexecuted nonce and current fee) is the highest-value item across F-CORE-060/061/062 and should be sequenced first; it is also what R3's own observation O6 asks for.

## QA (QA-CORE-SEN)

**Outcome: Not attempted (no toolchain).** No Rust toolchain exists on this host (`state/baseline.md` §1), so nothing was executed and no certainty moves. No PoC was written for this finding; the seven PoCs this run produced are in `rust-audit/poc/` for F-CORE-001, -002, -060, -067 and F-SEN-001, -002, -015. This section is a remediation-soundness check only.

### Remediation check

**Sound: option 2 first, then option 5; option 1 needs its own caveat honoured; option 3 cannot be implemented on the current schema.**

Option 2 (gauges for in-flight count, oldest unexecuted nonce, blocks since allocation, current
`max_priority_fee_per_gas`) is the cheapest change here and the one I would take first. It does not
prevent the wedge but converts an invisible permanent outage into an alertable one, and — as the
finding notes — the same gauges cover **F-CORE-060** and **F-CORE-061**. Three findings, one metric
set.

Option 1 (assert `status.nonce <= COALESCE(MAX(nonce), status.nonce) + 1` and fail non-intermittently)
is sound **only with the two conditions the finding itself attaches**: a bounded retry before the
error escalates (or a transiently inconsistent provider becomes fatal, which A4 makes a live risk),
and configurability, because an external sender using the same key is a supported deployment per
claim 8. Both conditions are load-bearing; an implementation that drops either is worse than the
defect.

**Option 3 (a release path) is not implementable on the current schema.** Its correctness rests on
"the row has never been accepted into a mempool", and the schema cannot express that:
`submitted_at IS NULL` means *either* "never submitted" *or* "rejected as underpriced", because the
underpriced arm deliberately writes `block: None` (`tx/mod.rs:274-282`). That is the same overload
that makes **F-CORE-067 option 3** unsound, and **F-CORE-060 option 5** is the fix for it. Option 3
is sound *after* option 5 of F-CORE-060 lands and not before; releasing a nonce for a row that is in
fact in a mempool risks a duplicate onchain transaction, which is precisely what the queue exists to
prevent.

Option 4 (fill the gap with zero-value self-transfers) is crude but is the standard operational
remedy, and encoding it removes the need for manual SQLite surgery — which is currently the only
recovery and is documented nowhere. Sound.

Option 5 (`UNIQUE(nonce)` plus indexes on `nonce` and `executed_at`) does not fix this finding and
the text says so, but it turns any future allocation bug into a loud database error instead of silent
divergence. Cheap, and worth taking regardless.

Option 6 (document the operator recovery procedure) is the one thing here that is currently entirely
absent and should not be deferred.

## In-flight impact (FWD)

**Pertains to unmerged branches, not to `main`.** Assessed against the "Batched Execution" stack
(`origin/feat/batex_0` … `origin/feat/batex_4`, PRs #899–#904). **Effect: worsen.** PR #904 is
literally "[Phase 4] Adjust nonce handling", and it does not address this finding: allocation remains
`MAX(status.nonce, high_water + span)`, so it still never allocates *into* a gap below the high-water
mark, still never releases an allocated nonce, and `prune` still deletes only executed rows and
*unallocated* expired ones — so a row holding an unincludable nonce is still deleted by nothing.
There is still no `chain_nonce <= MAX(nonce) + 1` consistency check, no error and no metric. What
Phase 4 adds is a *first-party* way to reach this defect: a transaction carrying an `authorization`
now reserves **two** nonces (`nonce + IIF(json_extract(request, '$.authorization') IS NULL, 1, 2)`),
the second of which is consumed not by the queue but by the chain applying the self-signed
authorization. If the authorization does not apply — which the epic itself concedes is reachable, and
which A4's inconsistent-RPC assumption supplies a third route to — the queue has written exactly the
permanent, unfillable gap this finding describes, deliberately, into durable state. The epic argues
this is acceptable because it is a "loud failure"; the alarm is a single `tracing::error!` that
self-clears on the next block. Filed separately as **`F-CORE-069`**. Severity and certainty of this
finding unchanged; its reachability increases. See `rust-audit/report/IN-FLIGHT.md`.
