## Claim

R5's coverage log records seeded lead **VAL-H8** ("re-reveal to become `last_signer` and stall the
ceremony") as mechanically confirmed but declined to file it, writing "Left to the Critic as a Low
observation; I did not out-rank R4/R6 on it." No Critic took it and the Coverage Critic reports it
unowned. I have examined it; it is a real, attacker-controlled liveness tax, and it is Low.

`handle_sign_revealed_nonces` sets `last_signer = Some(event.participant)` on **every** accepted
reveal, with no first-writer-wins and no check that the participant has not already revealed
(`state/sign.rs:282-285`); `revealed` is a `BTreeMap`, so a repeat reveal leaves `revealed.len`
unchanged and the round does not close. The onchain side does not deduplicate either:
`signRevealNonces` verifies the Merkle inclusion of `(d, e)` against the committed chunk and emits,
with no "already revealed" guard (`contracts/src/FROSTCoordinator.sol:554-558`), and re-revealing the
*same* nonce pair passes that verification trivially.

`last_signer` is not decorative. When a `CollectNonceCommitments` round times out,
`restart_signing_ceremony` is called with `*last_signer` (`state/sign.rs:645-655`), and that value
becomes both the new session's `responsible` field and the sole test for who queues the restarting
`Action::Sign`: `if last_signer == Some(self.account) { commands.push(Command::Action(Action::Sign
{ .. })) }` (`:547-553`). By convention the last participant to reveal is responsible for kicking the
ceremony off again. A signer who arranges to be last — by withholding its own reveal until the round
is about to time out, or by re-revealing over an honest signer's reveal — becomes responsible and can
then simply not act. Nobody else queues the `Action::Sign`, and the ceremony burns a second
`signing_timeout` before the `WaitingForRequest` branch removes the defaulter from `signers`, sets
`*responsible = None` and makes everyone responsible (`:586-615`).

The cost to the attacker is one `signRevealNonces` transaction. The cost to the network is one extra
`signing_timeout` — 6 blocks, ~30 s at A10's parameters — per targeted ceremony, repeatable for every
message, because the removal from `signers` is scoped to that one session.

## Trigger

1. A signing ceremony for message `m` is in `CollectNonceCommitments` and is going to time out —
   which requires at least one member of `signers` not to reveal. Under A2 the attacker can supply
   that themselves if they hold two positions in the selection, or simply wait for an ordinary
   stall, which `restart_signing_ceremony` exists precisely to handle.
2. Shortly before `deadline`, the attacker (a member of `signers`) submits `signRevealNonces` for
   `sid`. If they have not revealed yet this is their first reveal; if they have, it is a repeat and
   the contract accepts it anyway (basis 3). Either way every honest validator sets
   `last_signer = attacker` (basis 1) and, because `revealed.len` did not change in the repeat
   case, the round stays open (basis 2).
3. The deadline passes. Every honest validator computes
   `restart_signing_ceremony(..., last_signer = attacker)`, so none of them queues `Action::Sign`
   (basis 4, 5), and each enters `WaitingForRequest { responsible: Some(attacker) }`.
4. The attacker does nothing. A second `signing_timeout` elapses before `:586-615` removes them from
   `signers` and makes everyone responsible.
5. Net effect: `2 * signing_timeout` (12 blocks, ~60 s at A10) instead of one, for one transaction,
   and repeatable per message because the `signers` removal is per session.

## Considered and rejected

- **"The offender is removed, so this self-limits."** True, and it is why this is Low rather than
  Medium: `signers.remove(previously_responsible)` plus `*responsible = None` (basis 6) guarantees
  the ceremony recovers after one extra timeout, and if the attacker's removal drops `signers` below
  `group_threshold` the session is abandoned and the packet can be re-proposed. The damage is
  bounded delay, not denial.
- **"The attacker must win a race against the last honest reveal."** They must in the *re-reveal*
  variant, but not in the *withhold* variant: a signer who has not yet revealed can always reveal
  last by construction, and revealing last is exactly what makes them `last_signer`. The withhold
  variant is the cheap one and needs no timing precision.
- **"This is F-VAL-032."** No. F-VAL-032 is a session dropped and never re-created because no nonce
  is linked. Here the session survives and is correctly restarted; the defect is that the *choice of
  who restarts it* is taken from an attacker-controllable field with no accountability.
- **"The contract should deduplicate."** Under A7 the Solidity is the reference and receives no
  findings; and a reveal-once rule onchain would be a protocol change. The fix belongs in the Rust
  side, which is free to keep the *first* accepted reveal as `last_signer`.
- **Severity check.** PROMPT.md §8 would put "a stall an attacker can trigger deliberately" at High.
  This is not a stall: it is a bounded, self-healing delay of one `signing_timeout`, after which the
  offender is excluded from that selection. Low is the correct band.

## Remediation options

1. **First-writer-wins.** Set `last_signer` only when the participant was not already in `revealed`
   (`last_signer.get_or_insert(event.participant)` guarded on
   `revealed.insert(...).is_none`), so a repeat reveal cannot steal responsibility. One line;
   removes the re-reveal variant entirely and costs nothing.
2. **Do not derive responsibility from reveal order.** Choose the restarting party deterministically
   from data the attacker does not control — for example the lowest FROST identifier in `signers`, or
   `signers` rotated by `signature_id` — so responsibility is unforgeable and every validator agrees
   on it without any extra state. Removes the withhold variant too.
3. **Belt and braces:** when `responsible` fails to act, remember it beyond the session (a small
   per-epoch counter) so a participant that repeatedly defaults is dropped from selections rather
   than costing one timeout per message.

Tests to add: a `handle_sign_revealed_nonces` unit test asserting that a second reveal from the same
participant leaves `last_signer` unchanged, and a `handle_signing_timeouts` test asserting that
exactly one validator queues `Action::Sign` after a `CollectNonceCommitments` timeout. `state/sign.rs`
currently has **no** test module at all (`state/baseline.md` §5 lists the whole of
`validator/src/state/` at zero tests), so these would be the first.

## Trail

- Critic C-VAL-B: drafted. Promoted from `state/agents/R5.md`, which confirmed VAL-H8
  mechanically ("`last_signer = Some(event.participant)` is overwritten on every accepted reveal …
  and the contract does not dedupe reveals") but filed nothing, deferring it to a Critic; the
  Coverage Critic reports it unowned. Re-derived from `state/sign.rs` and `FROSTCoordinator.sol`
  independently. I confirm R5's bound — the offender is removed one timeout later
  (`state/sign.rs:595-614`) — and agree with their Low judgement; the reason to file rather than drop
  it is that the fix is one line and the current code makes an attacker-controlled field the sole
  input to a liveness decision. Self-estimate 50%: mechanism `E2`, trigger `E2` for the withhold
  variant, held mid-band because the precondition (a round that is going to time out anyway) is not
  something the attacker fully controls without a second position in the selection.

## QA (QA-VAL)

**Outcome: Not attempted (no toolchain).** Certainty unchanged at **50%**; severity Low unchanged.
No PoC directory — not in my assigned set. The harness it needs is the one in
[`poc/F-VAL-030-032-061/nonce_state.rs`](../poc/F-VAL-030-032-061/nonce_state.rs), which already
constructs `SigningState::CollectNonceCommitments` values and a `Transition`; the two tests the
finding proposes are a short extension of it and should be written there rather than in a new
directory.

### What would be run, and what it would show

1. `handle_sign_revealed_nonces` twice from the same participant, asserting `last_signer` is
   unchanged by the second call. Fails today (`state/sign.rs:278-285` assigns unconditionally);
   passes under remediation option 1. `E1` for the mechanism in about fifteen lines.
2. A `CollectNonceCommitments` timeout, asserting that **exactly one** validator queues
   `Action::Sign`. This is the assertion that turns the finding from "a value is overwritten" into
   "responsibility is forgeable", and it is the one worth the effort: it exercises
   `handle_signing_timeouts`' restart path (`state/sign.rs:522-562`, `:631-660`) from the state the
   first test produces.

Neither would move the certainty far, because what is in doubt here is not the mechanism — which is
a plain read — but whether making oneself "responsible" and then doing nothing is worth a
transaction to an attacker. That is a judgement about incentives, and no unit test settles it. 50%
is the right place for it.

### Remediation check

**Option 1 (first-writer-wins) is sound and is the minimal fix.** One caution on the sketch as
written: `last_signer.get_or_insert(event.participant)` guarded on `revealed.insert(..).is_none`
conflates two different "firsts" — the first *reveal* and the first *participant*. What the restart
path actually wants is "the participant whose reveal completed the set", i.e. the last one, and
first-writer-wins changes that semantic. It removes the re-reveal variant, which is the point, but
the ticket should say explicitly which participant is intended to be responsible after the change,
because the field's name will no longer describe it.

**Option 2 (derive responsibility deterministically from `signers`) is sound and is what I would
recommend.** It removes both variants — the re-reveal *and* the withhold — because nothing an
attacker sends changes the answer, and it removes a field from snapshotted state rather than adding
one. Of the two concrete suggestions, "lowest FROST identifier in `signers`" is fragile (the same
validator is responsible every time, and if it is faulty every ceremony stalls); "`signers` rotated
by `signature_id`" is the better one, since `signature_id` is assigned by the contract, is unknown
before the `Sign` lands, and spreads the cost. Specify that variant.

**Option 3 (remember a defaulting participant beyond the session) is sound and should be deferred.**
It needs new per-epoch state and a policy for when to forgive, and its benefit is bounded by
whatever option 2 already achieves. File it, do not schedule it with the other two.

**Note on scope.** All three options address who *restarts* the ceremony. None addresses that the
contract does not deduplicate reveals in the first place (`FROSTCoordinator.sol:554-558`), which is
the precondition for the re-reveal variant. Under A7 that is a Solidity observation and out of scope
for a Rust fix, but it belongs in the ticket as the reason option 1 is a workaround and option 2 is
a fix.

## Post-merge revalidation (RV-VAL)

**Verdict: STILL VALID.** Certainty and severity unchanged. Merge commit `a7f3915`, which merges
`origin/main` and the Certora FROST audit fixes I-01..I-09. `crates/validator` is untouched by
the merge, so this finding's mechanism is byte-identical.

The merge shifts `contracts/src/FROSTCoordinator.sol` by two documentation-only hunks
(`9e41b49`: NatSpec on the `SignShared` event and on `signShare`). Every function this file
quotes is byte-identical — only its address moved. Corrected citations:

| Old | New |
| --- | --- |
| `FROSTCoordinator.sol:554-558` (basis row 3, `signRevealNonces` does not deduplicate) | **`:560-564`** |

`signRevealNonces` is byte-identical and still has no "already revealed" guard.
