## Claim

The runtime contract says actions are replayed after a crash or reorg, and the transaction queue deduplicates nothing — `enqueue` is an unconditional `INSERT` — so idempotency has to come from the encoder or from the contract. Auditing all twelve `Action` variants against what they submit, three do not have it:

1. **`Action::SetValidatorStaker` accumulates across restarts.** It is queued outside the state machine, from `main.rs`, whenever `Consensus.getValidatorStaker(account)` disagrees with the configured `staker` — and it is encoded with a hardcoded `None` expiry, so the queue never drops it. The onchain value cannot change until the queued transaction is mined, so every restart in the interim enqueues another identical one. A crash loop (or simply a rolling restart while the first transaction is still pending) produces N copies, each allocated its own nonce, each reserving 100 000 gas, and each occupying one of the `max_in_flight_transactions` (default 16) slots ahead of protocol-critical transactions.

2. **`Action::Preprocess` has a hardcoded `None` expiry**, with the comment "we cannot reliably know for how long it is valuable". It is the resume-driven action for `Effect::NonceTree`, and a replayed `NonceTree` draws a *different* chunk from the generator, so a reorg produces two `Preprocess` transactions with two different roots — neither of which expires. Both land; both register a chunk; the validator has paid twice and generated 2048 nonces where 1024 were wanted. This one self-heals (`handle_preprocess` links whichever chunk the chain actually reports), so the cost is gas, CPU and disk rather than correctness.

3. **A replayed `Action::Sign` burns a nonce sequence for every member of the group.** `Coordinator.sign` does not deduplicate by `(gid, message)`: it unconditionally does `uint64 sequence = state.sequence++` and mints a fresh signature id. On the validator side, `handle_sign` calls `NonceState::observe(event.sequence)` for *every* `Sign` of a tracked group before it tries to match a session. So one duplicated `Sign` transaction from this validator consumes one committed nonce coordinate from every validator in the group, for nothing. `Action::Sign` does carry an expiry, but it is the signing deadline — `signing_timeout`, default 6 blocks — so the window is small rather than absent. This is the self-inflicted version of the griefing vector VAL-H6 describes for external callers.

Compounding all three: `mark_executed` decides a transaction executed purely because the account nonce moved past it, never reading a receipt or status. A duplicate that reverts, and equally a transaction that runs out of gas under one of the twelve hardcoded gas limits, is recorded as executed and is never retried — the failure is invisible to the state machine, which believes the action was performed. Note that of the twelve limits only `KeyGenSecretShare` scales with its payload (`250_000 + 25_000 * share.f.len`); the other eleven are flat constants even where the calldata grows with the group size (`keyGenAndCommit` carries `threshold` curve points plus a PoAP proof at a flat 250 000). I have no gas measurements here and am not claiming any specific constant is too low — only that the design has no margin signal and that the consequence of being wrong is a silent, unretried liveness failure rather than a visible error.

| 3 | and it is queued outside the state machine on every startup where the RPC's view of the staker still differs | E2 | `crates/validator/src/main.rs:81-93` | `    // Reconcile the onchain staker association before starting the driver.`<br>`    if let Some(staker) = staker {`<br>`        let current_staker = Consensus::new(consensus, &provider)`<br>`            .getValidatorStaker(account)`<br>`            .call`<br>`            .await?;`<br>`        if current_staker != staker {`<br>`            tracing::info!(%account, %staker, "reconciling validator staker onchain");`<br>`            driver`<br>`                .queue_action(Action::SetValidatorStaker { staker })`<br>`                .await?;`<br>`        }`<br>`    }` |
| 4 | The queue has no deduplication of any kind: enqueue is an unconditional INSERT | E2 | `crates/core/src/tx/storage.rs:89-104` | `        let mut tx = self.pool.begin.await?;`<br>`        for (transaction, expires_at) in transactions {`<br>`            let request = serde_json::to_string(&transaction)?;`<br>`            sqlx::query("INSERT INTO transactions (request, expires_at) VALUES (?, ?)")`<br>`                .bind(request)`<br>`                .bind(expires_at.map(i64::try_from).transpose?)`<br>`                .execute(&mut *tx)`<br>`                .await?;`<br>`        }`<br>`        tx.commit.await?;`<br>`        Ok()`<br>`    }` |
| 5 | and a `None` expiry means the row is never dropped however stale it becomes | E2 | `crates/core/src/tx/mod.rs:128-141` | `    /// Queues `transaction` for execution, to be dropped if it has not been`<br>`    /// submitted by block `expires_at`, or never dropped if `expires_at` is`<br>`    /// `None`, then attempts to submit it (and any other queued transactions)`<br>`    /// onchain.`<br>`    pub async fn queue(`<br>`        &mut self,`<br>`        transactions: impl IntoIterator<Item = (Transaction, Option<u64>)>,`<br>`    ) -> Result<, Error> {`<br>`        self.storage.enqueue(transactions).await?;` |

## Trigger

- **Duplicate staker reconciliation:** start the validator with `staker` set and an onchain value that differs. It enqueues `setValidatorStaker`. Restart before that transaction is mined (roughly one to two blocks, or indefinitely if the queue is saturated or fees are underpriced): the startup check re-reads the still-stale onchain value and enqueues a second copy. Repeat per restart.
- **Duplicate preprocess:** a reorg within `max_reorg_depth` that uncles the block whose logs committed a chunk reservation, while `Effect::NonceTree` for it had already resumed and queued the `Preprocess` action. The replay draws a new chunk and queues a second `Preprocess`; neither has an expiry, so both are submitted.
- **Duplicate sign:** a reorg (or a restart replay) inside the `signing_timeout` window that re-runs the transition emitting `Action::Sign` for a message whose first `Sign` transaction has already been submitted. Both land; the group's sequence advances twice; every validator's `observe` consumes an extra coordinate.

## Considered and rejected

- **"The contract rejects duplicates, so replay is harmless."** True for most of the set and checked individually: a second `keyGenCommit` fails `GroupNotReady` / participant-already-registered, a second `keyGenConfirm`, `keyGenComplain` and `keyGenComplaintResponse` are rejected by `FROSTParticipantMap`'s per-participant state, `stageEpoch` is blocked by `_requireValidRollover`'s `epochs.staged == 0`, and `attestTransaction` by `require($attestations[message].isZero)`. `sign` and `preprocess` are the two that accept a repeat by design, and `setValidatorStaker` is idempotent onchain but not free. Those are the three above; the rest cost only gas.
- **"`expires_at: None` on `Preprocess` is a considered decision."** It is — the comment says so — and the reasoning is sound in isolation (a nonce chunk stays useful indefinitely). The problem is the interaction with a non-idempotent effect: because a replayed `Effect::NonceTree` yields a *different* root, the never-expiring action is not the same action twice but two different actions, both of which are then guaranteed to land.
- **"The startup staker check is a one-shot, so duplicates need a crash loop."** It needs only a restart inside the inclusion window of the previous attempt, which on Gnosis (A10, ~5 s blocks) is a handful of seconds under normal conditions and unbounded when the queue is backed up or fees are stale — and CORE-H6's uncapped fee bumping makes "backed up" a reachable state.
- **"A duplicate `Sign` is caught by the state machine."** It is caught for *session* purposes — the second `Sign` finds no `WaitingForRequest` entry and is dropped — but `observe` runs before that matching, on the line above, so the sequence is already consumed. The state machine cannot un-consume it.
- **Checked and clean:** every `to` address is correct (coordinator for the ten `Coordinator::*` calls, consensus for `attestTransaction`, `stageEpoch`, `setValidatorStaker`); every `value` is `U256::ZERO`; and I verified all twelve calldata selectors against the Solidity by computing `keccak256` of the canonical signatures with structs expanded to tuples and the user-defined value types resolved to `bytes32` — all match, with no selector collisions. No mis-encoded action was found.

## Remediation options

1. Give the queue an idempotency key. `enqueue` could take an optional caller-supplied key (the action's own discriminant plus its identifying fields) and `INSERT … ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING` against a partial unique index over unexecuted rows. This fixes the whole class in one place, for the sentinel too (SEN-H7 is the same root cause), and is where the fix belongs.
2. Narrowly, in this crate: move the staker reconciliation into the state machine so it is driven by `Consensus::ValidatorStakerSet` (already decoded and currently dropped at `state/mod.rs:461-462`) rather than a one-shot startup call, or give it a short expiry so a stale copy is dropped instead of queued forever.
3. Make `Effect::NonceTree` idempotent per reservation: key the generator request on `(group_id, chunk)` and return the already-generated chunk for a repeat, so a replay produces the same root and therefore the same `Preprocess` action, which then deduplicates naturally under option 1.
4. Do not re-emit `Action::Sign` when a signature id for that message is already tracked (`state.signature_id_to_message` already holds the mapping), so the replay is suppressed at the source.
5. Independently of the above: read receipts. Marking a transaction executed on a nonce advance alone hides both duplicate-revert and out-of-gas outcomes; fetching the receipt and recording `status == 0` would turn every gas-constant mistake from a silent stall into an alertable error, and would give the state machine something to react to.

Tests to add: a `service/action.rs` unit test pinning each variant's `(to, gas, expires_at)` triple, so the two `None` expiries are a deliberate, visible choice rather than an easy oversight; and a queue test asserting that two identical `enqueue` calls produce one submission once option 1 exists. `service/action.rs` has zero tests and 0.0% line coverage today.

## Trail

- Reviewer R6: drafted from the brief's instruction to check each action encoder against what it submits onchain. All twelve variants traced to their Solidity counterparts; selectors verified by computed keccak256. Self-estimate 70%: the three non-idempotent actions and the receipt-free execution inference are directly readable, but the practical impact of each is small and bounded, which is why this is filed as Low and as one finding rather than three.

## Critic (C-VAL-B)

Derived from `service/action.rs` in full, `main.rs:81-93`, `core/tx/storage.rs` and
`contracts/src/FROSTCoordinator.sol:524-558` before reading the Claim.

### Per-claim verdicts

All basis rows **Supported**; every citation re-opened and matched. The three specifics:

1. **`SetValidatorStaker` accumulates — Supported.** Queued from `main.rs:82-92` outside the state
   machine, encoded with a hardcoded `None` expiry (`action.rs:368-378`), and the startup check
   re-reads the still-stale onchain value on every restart. Nothing deduplicates:
   `TransactionStorage::enqueue` is an unconditional `INSERT`. C-CORE-B has promoted the core-side
   half of that as F-CORE-067, which is the right home for the missing idempotency key; this file
   remains canonical for the validator's three non-idempotent actions.
2. **`Preprocess` has no expiry — Supported.** `action.rs:252-254` with the comment quoted verbatim.
   Self-healing as the reviewer says, because `handle_preprocess` links whatever chunk the chain
   reports (`state/preprocess.rs:79`); the cost is gas, CPU and an orphaned 1024-nonce chunk that
   `retain_groups` can never reclaim (F-VAL-035(b)).
3. **A duplicate `Sign` burns a sequence for the whole group — Supported, and this is the one that
   matters.** `Coordinator.sign` deduplicates nothing: `require(message != 0)`,
   `status == FINALIZED`, then `uint64 sequence = state.sequence++`
   (`contracts/src/FROSTCoordinator.sol:530-541`). On the Rust side `handle_sign` calls
   `epoch.nonces.observe(event.sequence)` in the `match` scrutinee, before any session matching
   (`state/sign.rs:30-35`), so the consumption is unconditional and applies to **every** validator
   tracking that group, not just the one that duplicated the transaction.

The `mark_executed` point is Supported too: `core/tx/storage.rs:222-235` infers execution from the
account nonce moving past the transaction and never reads a receipt, so a revert or an out-of-gas is
recorded as executed and never retried. The reviewer is careful not to claim any specific gas
constant is too low, which is the right restraint with no Foundry available (A9 false). No `H` claims.

### Severity: Low → Medium. Checked both ways, as the brief asked

Arguments for Low, which I weighed: items 1 and 2 cost only gas and CPU and self-heal; item 3's
window is bounded by `signing_timeout` (6 blocks) because `Action::Sign` does carry an expiry; and
none of the three produces a wrong attestation.

What tips it to Medium is item 3 composed with F-VAL-032, which I have raised to High. A burned
sequence is not merely a wasted coordinate: `observe` advances `next_sequence` for every validator,
and the moment that advance crosses out of a linked chunk, the *next* `Sign` for a tracked message
takes `state/sign.rs:106-114` and the session is dropped and never re-created — for an
`EpochRollover` packet, permanently (`state/keygen.rs:529-548` is the only insertion point). So a
self-inflicted duplicate `Sign` after a reorg is not a gas-waste bug; it is a step toward losing a
ceremony, and the validator does it to the whole group. That is "incorrect behaviour under unusual
but reachable conditions" — Medium — rather than a robustness nit. It is not High, because the
trigger is a reorg or restart replay inside a 6-block window rather than anything an attacker steers,
and because F-VAL-032 already carries the exclusion impact at High.

### Finding verdict

**Confirmed — 70%.** Mechanism `E2` for all three actions and for the `mark_executed` inference; the
triggers are concrete (a restart before the staker transaction mines; a reorg inside
`max_reorg_depth`) and code-verified end to end. Held below 85 because the frequency of each depends
on queue latency and reorg depth, neither measurable here, and because the gas-margin observation
that compounds it is explicitly unquantified.

**Remediation note.** The highest-value single change is an idempotency key on
`TransactionStorage::enqueue` keyed on the encoded calldata plus target — it fixes all three at once
and belongs in `core` (F-CORE-067). Failing that, gate the `main.rs` staker reconciliation on
"no pending `setValidatorStaker` in the queue", which is a two-line query against the storage the
queue already has.

## QA (QA-VAL)

**Outcome: Not attempted (no toolchain).** Certainty unchanged at **70%**; severity Low / Medium
unchanged. No PoC directory — not in my assigned set. Both suggested tests are cheap and belong
in-tree: the action-triple test in `crates/validator/src/service/action.rs` (which has no test module
today) and the queue-deduplication test in `crates/core/src/tx/storage.rs` (which does).

### What would be run, and what it would show

1. **Pin each action's `(to, gas, expires_at)` triple.** This is the test that makes the finding's
   central observation permanent rather than a one-time reading: `Action::Preprocess` and
   `Action::SetValidatorStaker` are the only two queued with `expires_at: None`
   (`service/action.rs:237-255`, `:368-378`), and a table-driven test makes that a deliberate,
   reviewable choice instead of an easy oversight. It is `E1` for the claim and it costs twenty
   lines. Do this one first — it is the cheapest thing in the finding and it does not depend on any
   fix landing.
2. **Two identical `enqueue` calls produce one submission** — only meaningful once option 1 exists,
   so it is the acceptance test, not a reproduction.

Neither would move the certainty, which C-VAL-B correctly bounded by "the frequency of each depends
on queue latency and reorg depth, neither measurable here". Nothing I can do offline changes that.

### Remediation check

**Option 1 (an idempotency key on `TransactionStorage::enqueue`) is sound, is the right place, and
is correctly identified as belonging in `core`** — it fixes the validator's three cases and the
sentinel's (SEN-H7) in one change. Two things to specify:

- **The key must not be the raw calldata alone.** `Action::Sign` for the same message on two
  different branches encodes identically but is legitimately a different request after a reorg that
  rebound the sequence; `Action::Preprocess` for two different roots encodes differently but is the
  same intent. A key of `(target, selector, identifying-fields)` chosen per action is right; "the
  encoded calldata plus target" as C-VAL-B phrases it is right for these three and should be stated
  as a per-action choice rather than a blanket rule, or it will be applied where it is wrong.
- **The partial unique index must be over *unexecuted* rows**, as the option says. Getting that
  wrong turns a legitimate second `Sign` months later into a silent drop, which is a worse failure
  than the duplicate it prevents.

**Option 4 (do not re-emit `Action::Sign` when a signature id for that message is already tracked)
is sound and is the cheapest of the five**, since `state.signature_id_to_message` already holds the
mapping (`state/mod.rs:52-53`). It suppresses the replay at the source, which is better than
deduplicating it at the queue. Note the interaction with **F-VAL-032**: that finding's option 2
changes when the session — and therefore the mapping — is removed, so the two must be reviewed
together or the suppression can key on state that has just been dropped.

**Option 2 (drive staker reconciliation from `Consensus::ValidatorStakerSet`) is sound and is
strictly better than the "short expiry" alternative it offers.** The event is already decoded and
currently dropped (`state/mod.rs:461-462`), so this replaces a one-shot startup call with a
state-machine-driven one and removes the "queued forever" case entirely rather than bounding it.
Take the first half, not the second.

**Option 3 (make `Effect::NonceTree` idempotent per reservation) is sound and is the same change as
F-VAL-030 option 4 and F-VAL-035 option 2** — all three need the chunk index carried through the
effect and the resume. Schedule them as one piece of work; costed separately they each look
marginal, and together they are the fix for three findings.

**Option 5 (read receipts) is sound and is the most important item in the list, and its framing
undersells it.** `mark_executed` records a transaction as executed on a nonce advance alone
(`crates/core/src/tx/storage.rs:222-235`), so a **reverted** transaction is indistinguishable from a
successful one at every layer. That is not only "hiding duplicate-revert and out-of-gas outcomes":
it means a failed `Action::Preprocess` is silently forgotten, which is one more path into
**F-VAL-030**'s phantom chunk and **F-VAL-039**'s window, and a failed `Action::KeyGenAndCommit` is
one more path into **F-VAL-004**'s stall. It should be reported as a shared root cause, not as a
fifth option on a deduplication finding.

## Post-merge revalidation (RV-VAL)

**Verdict: STILL VALID.** Certainty and severity unchanged. Merge commit `a7f3915`, which merges
`origin/main` and the Certora FROST audit fixes I-01..I-09. `crates/validator` is untouched by
the merge, so this finding's mechanism is byte-identical.

The merge shifts `contracts/src/FROSTCoordinator.sol` by two documentation-only hunks
(`9e41b49`: NatSpec on the `SignShared` event and on `signShare`). Every function this file
quotes is byte-identical — only its address moved. Corrected citations:

| Old | New |
| --- | --- |
| `FROSTCoordinator.sol:530-542` (Location, basis row 8) | **`:536-548`** |
| `FROSTCoordinator.sol:530-541` | **`:536-547`** |
| `FROSTCoordinator.sol:524-558` | **`:530-564`** |

`Coordinator.sign` still does not deduplicate by `(gid, message)`: every call mints a new signature
id and increments the group sequence.

## In-flight impact (FWD)

**Pertains to unmerged branches, not to `main`.** Assessed against the "Batched Execution" stack
(`origin/feat/batex_0` … `origin/feat/batex_4`, PRs #899–#904). **Effect: unchanged, worsen
downstream.** `crates/validator/src/service/action.rs` takes **+12 lines** in the cumulative diff and
every one of them is a mechanical `authorization: None` initialiser added to a `Transaction` literal
because Phase 3 gave the struct a new field. No encoder logic, no expiry, and none of the twelve
hardcoded gas constants changes. Points 1–3 therefore reproduce verbatim at the branch tip:
`SetValidatorStaker` is still encoded with a hardcoded `None` expiry at `:253`, `Preprocess` still
carries `None` with the same "we cannot reliably know for how long it is valuable" comment, and
`Action::Sign` still relies on an expiry equal to the signing deadline. On the queue side
`enqueue` is unchanged (`F-CORE-067`), so nothing deduplicates. The compounding note at the end of
this finding — "a duplicate that reverts, and equally a transaction that runs out of gas under one of
the twelve hardcoded gas limits, is recorded as executed and is never retried" — is exactly what the
batching work amplifies: under Phase 7 that same silent, unretried failure covers a whole batch, and
`Safenet7702Executor.execute` swallows an under-gassed or reverting call into a `CallFailed` event on
the validator's own EOA, which nothing indexes. The "no margin signal" observation about the flat
gas constants also becomes the input to an unmeasured batch gas formula the epic flags as an open
question. Filed as **`F-CORE-068`**. A replayed `Action::Sign` batched with other actions still burns
one committed nonce coordinate from every validator in the group. Severity and certainty unchanged.
