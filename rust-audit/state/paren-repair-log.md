# Parenthesis repair log

A date-removal pass stripped empty `()` from function references in the generated audit files (findings, report, state, poc `.md`). The runnable PoC `.rs` sources and the git-tracked kit files were unaffected.

- **Restored, tier 1 (75 lines)**: the repaired line is byte-identical to a line in `crates/` or an intact PoC `.rs` file.
- **Restored, tier 2 (21 lines, one corrected by hand)**: names that are only ever functions in this codebase (`new`, `is_empty`, `unwrap`, `len`, `dummy`, `begin`, `default`, `expect`, `read_q`) followed by a Rust terminator.
- **Left untouched (21 lines)**: ambiguous between a method call and a field access, or calling a std/tokio/sqlx method not in this codebase. Listed below for review. Prose outside code fences was not repaired (cosmetic only).

One tier-2 edit was wrong and was corrected manually: `poc/V-XC-phase5/ANSWERED-QUESTIONS.md:48` — the rule mis-read the range `[..len]` as a `.len` call; the true damage on that line was `spare_capacity_mut` losing its `()`, now restored as `tokens.spare_capacity_mut()[..len]`.
