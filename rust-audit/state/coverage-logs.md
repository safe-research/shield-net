# Reviewer coverage logs

The ten reviewer coverage logs, merged into one document. Each section records what that reviewer read, every command they ran, and — most usefully for a checker — every hypothesis they **considered and rejected**, with the citation that refuted it.

Anchors are stable: link to a reviewer as `state/coverage-logs.md#r4`. Citations written before this merge that pointed at `state/agents/R4.md`, with or without a line range, now resolve to the `#r4` section below.

### 3. Findings written

| ID | Title (short) | Reviewer severity | Self-estimate |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| F-CORE-001 | Persisted indexer state is bound to block numbers only; a downtime reorg silently defeats `max_reorg_depth` | High | 85% |
| F-CORE-002 | `use_client_filtering`'s bloom check disables itself after three failures — including its own failures | High | 85% mechanism / 70% reachability |
| F-CORE-003 | `revalidate_last_block` treats a `null` block as an uncle → spurious reorg, rollback and replay | Medium | 75% / 60% |
| F-CORE-004 | No terminal error state: deterministic failures stall the indexer forever; one log can stall every validator | High | 80% / 65% |
| F-CORE-005 | `max_reorg_depth = 0` documents "fail loudly" but disables the uncled-block recovery and hangs | Low | 80% |
| F-CORE-006 | Address × topic cross-product matching: any watched address can emit any watched event | Medium | 80% / 55% |
| F-CORE-007 | Unbounded, undelayed mid-init rescan loop; invisible at the default log level while `/health` is OK | Low | 70% / 45% |
| F-CORE-008 | Block polling scheduled against the host wall clock: skew silently and permanently lags indexing | Low | 75% / 35% |
| F-CORE-009 | No range validation on the block-watcher config (`block_time = 0`, unbounded `max_reorg_depth`, future `start_block`) | Low | 80% |

---

### 4. Assigned leads: confirmed or refuted

| Lead | Outcome | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **CORE-H1** (restart resumes from an unverified snapshot) | **Confirmed** → F-CORE-001 | `state/storage.rs:51-57` has no hash column; `grep -rn "hash" crates/core/src/state/` returns exactly one match, `state/mod.rs:376`, which is a `Default::default` in a test fixture. `blocks.rs:244-289` uses only numbers. Sharpened: pruning (`state/storage.rs:151-159`) puts the retained anchor at `head - max_reorg_depth`, so the reorg depth silently accepted across a restart is exactly the depth that is fatal while running. |
| **CORE-H2** (client filtering degrades after three failures) | **Confirmed** → F-CORE-002 | `events.rs:369-380` gates `ClientFiltered` on `retries < block_single_query_retry_count`; `events.rs:382-392` increments `retries` on _any_ error including `IncompleteLogs`; `events.rs:412-421` has no completeness check. New: the handbook (`docs/validator-handbook.md:33-35`) documents the exact failure mode the fallback re-enters, and no test combines `use_client_filtering: true` with an exhausted budget (`events.rs:1384-1448` uses the default `false`). |
| **CORE-H4** (address-agnostic decoding) | **Confirmed (core mechanism)** → F-CORE-006 | `events.rs:404-410`, `415-419`, `458-465` all apply `address ∈ A AND topic0 ∈ T`; `events.rs:497-506` copies the address without using it; `events.rs:577-591` picks the first ABI that decodes. Consumer confirmed: `validator/src/state/mod.rs:414-460` passes `log.address` to exactly one of fifteen handlers. Validator-side severity left to R6 (VAL-H2). |
| **CORE-H8** (deterministic errors retried forever) | **Confirmed and escalated** → F-CORE-004 | `events.rs:382-392` and `337-348` have no give-up branch; `index/mod.rs:123-126` re-raises; `driver.rs:209-223` retries everything but `ExceededMaxReorgDepth`. Escalated to High because the `DecodeLog` variant is reachable from a single `LOG1` at a watched oracle address (`validator/src/main.rs:56-57`) and is deterministic across every validator watching it. |
| **CORE-H9** (lagging backend `null` → spurious uncle) | **Confirmed** → F-CORE-003 | `blocks.rs:504-507` flattens the `Option` before comparing; `blocks.rs:1120-1131` is a test that pins the behaviour. Raised above the analysis' 45% because one backend condition produces _both_ RPC answers in the trigger, not two independent failures. |
| **CORE-H14** (`max_reorg_depth = 0` loops instead of failing loudly) | **Confirmed** → F-CORE-005 | `blocks.rs:453-462` and `333-340` leave `recent` permanently empty at depth 0 (pinned by `blocks.rs:811-837` and `1251-1275`); `blocks.rs:494-501` then always returns `Ok(None)`; `index/mod.rs:85-97` shows `blocks.next` — and therefore the `ExceededMaxReorgDepth` check — is unreachable while `next_logs` errors. |
| **M9** (driver retries every watcher error every 100 ms) | **Confirmed as context only** | `driver.rs:206-231` read and quoted as basis 8 of F-CORE-004; the indexing-side error taxonomy is my finding, the driver-side backoff/exit policy is left to R2 as instructed. |
| **Core checklist 1** (fork binding of persisted state) | Answered → F-CORE-001. No operator guidance exists for recovering from `ExceededMaxReorgDepth`: `grep -rn -i "reorg" docs/` returns only `docs/overview.md:38, 61-76`, none of which mentions the exit or the database. |
| **Core checklist 3** (log completeness guarantees) | Answered → F-CORE-002. Full enumeration of paths that commit a block's events without a completeness check is in section 5 below. |
| **Core checklist 4** (per-address event authority) | Answered → F-CORE-006. |
| **Core checklist 8** (permanent retry loops) | Answered → F-CORE-004, F-CORE-005, F-CORE-007. |
| **Core checklist 9** (spurious uncles) | Answered → F-CORE-003. |

---

### 5. Enumeration requested by core checklist item 3 — every path that commits a block's events

| Path | Completeness check | Verdict |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Fetch::SingleQuery(Hash)` — default new-block path (`events.rs:404-411`) | none (only `max_logs_per_query`, default `None`, and only for _over_-long results) | Unverified by design; the crate's documented remedy is `use_client_filtering`. |
| `Fetch::ClientFiltered` (`events.rs:441-466`) | bloom equality against the header (`events.rs:450`) | Verified — but only for `retries < block_single_query_retry_count`. **F-CORE-002.** |
| `Fetch::MultipleQueries(Hash)` — the post-retry fallback (`events.rs:412-440`) | none | Unverified; accepting an empty result here is **F-CORE-002**. |
| `Fetch::SingleQuery(Range)` — warp pages with `page_size > 1` (`events.rs:314-322`) | none | Unverified. Bloom equality is inherently per-block, so a range page cannot be checked this way; noted in F-CORE-002 because it means the whole post-restart catch-up is unverified even with `use_client_filtering` on. |
| `Fetch::MultipleQueries(Range)` — warp pages at `page_size == 1` (`events.rs:318-322`) | none | Unverified, same as above. |
| `fallible_events` drop (`events.rs:426-436`) | none, deliberately | The dropped topic's logs are omitted and the update is still emitted as complete for the range. Not configured by any service (`grep -rn "fallible_events" crates/` matches only `core/src/index/events.rs` and one test in `core/src/index/mod.rs:220`). Recorded as observation O-6; matches analysis H15. |

The `may_contain_log` helper that could gate an _empty_ result on the header bloom exists and is tested (`bloom.rs:23-35`, tests at `68-69` and `520`) but has **no production caller** — `grep -rn "may_contain_log\|compute_logs_bloom" crates/` shows `may_contain_log` only inside `bloom.rs`, and the module is `#[allow(dead_code)]` at `index/mod.rs:5-6`. That is the cheapest available remediation for F-CORE-002 and is written up there.

---

### 6. Hypotheses considered and rejected (with the citation that refuted each)

1. **`Watcher::next` can lose a block update when `on_block_update` errors with `UnexpectedBlockUpdate`.** Rejected: `index/mod.rs:86-95` calls `on_block_update` only on the branch where `next_logs` returned `Ok(None)`, and `EventWatcher::next` returns `Ok(None)` only from `Step::Idle` (`events.rs:282-283`). Nothing mutates `step` between those two points, and `on_block_update` errors only when `!matches!(self.step, Step::Idle)` (`events.rs:230-232`). _Flagged to the Critic:_ if this ever became reachable it would be a lost block, because `blocks.next` has already popped the queue entry (`blocks.rs:387-389`) by then.
2. **`on_block_invalidated` can mismatch and deadlock the recovery path.** Attempted hard; rejected but with residual doubt (recorded as observation O-1). If `revalidate_last_block` returned an `InvalidatedBlock` whose hash differed from `Step::Block.block_hash`, the `?` at `index/mod.rs:121` would propagate `UnexpectedBlockInvalidation` _after_ `revalidate_last_block` had already truncated `recent`, rewound `pending`, cleared the queue and pushed `Uncle` (`blocks.rs:522-532`) — and every subsequent retry would hit the `Some(_) => return Ok(None)` guard at `blocks.rs:488` because the queue front is now an `Uncle`, producing a permanent loop. I could not construct a reachable mismatch: the driver alternates strictly (`index/mod.rs:85-97`), so `Step::Block`'s hash is always the last emitted `New`, and `rposition(|block| next_number.is_none_or(|number| block.number < number))` (`blocks.rs:494-497`) selects exactly that block in each queue shape I traced (empty queue; `queue.front == New{n+1}` after init with and without `start_block`; after a resume-uncle; after a previous revalidation). Left as an observation because the consequence is severe and the argument is a case analysis, not an invariant enforced in code.
3. **Duplicate `topic0` values in `Events::topics` cause duplicated logs in `MultipleQueries`.** Mechanism confirmed — `events.rs:569-575` concatenates each ABI's `SELECTORS` with no de-duplication, and `events.rs:413-439` maps over `self.topics` and `.concat`s, so a repeated topic yields the same log twice; `state/mod.rs:207-211` uses a _strict_ comparison (`(a.block, a.index) < (b.block, b.index)`), so duplicates would be `BadUpdate` and a fail-stop. Rejected as a finding because it is not reachable today: `grep -n "event " crates/validator/src/bindings.rs crates/sentinel/src/bindings.rs` shows the validator's three ABIs (`Consensus`, `FROSTCoordinator`, `Oracle`) and the sentinel's two (`SentinelOracle`, `Consensus`) declare no two events with the same signature. Kept as observation O-2 and mentioned in F-CORE-006's "Considered and rejected".
4. **`decode_and_sort`'s `sort_unstable_by_key` gives a non-deterministic order.** Rejected as harmful: on a real chain `(block_number, log_index)` is unique, so instability is unobservable; and where it would not be unique (the duplicate-topic case above) the state machine rejects the batch outright (`state/mod.rs:207-211`) rather than applying either order.
5. **An uncle/warp sequence can skip or duplicate a block.** Rejected. The uncle path rewinds `pending` to exactly the uncled block (`blocks.rs:425-428`), so the replacement for that same height is fetched next; the block that triggered detection is discarded and re-fetched. `pending` advances by exactly one per accepted block (`blocks.rs:538-543`). `Warp` is queued only for `from <= safe` (`blocks.rs:271-278`, `279-289`), and the state machine's `is_next_in_range` guards (`state/mod.rs:200-234`) reject any gap. The deep-reorg test `blocks.rs:975-1031` asserts N uncles followed by N news for an N-deep reorg.
6. **`revalidate_last_block` can invalidate the `safe` anchor and corrupt the window.** Rejected: it only ever indexes into `recent` (`blocks.rs:494-502`) and never writes `self.safe`; the invariant is documented at `blocks.rs:479-482` and asserted by `revalidate_can_invalidate_the_oldest_tracked_block` (`blocks.rs:1168-1204`).
7. **Eviction into `safe` can leave a stale anchor that wrongly accepts a reorged block.** Rejected: `blocks.rs:453-462` writes `self.safe` from the evicted header in the same statement that pops it, and `evicting_from_recent_promotes_the_block_to_safe` (`blocks.rs:1206-1249`) is a regression test written specifically for this.
8. **The `expect`s in my files are reachable panics.** Rejected, all four re-derived: `blocks.rs:336` (`recent.pop_front`) — the scan runs at least once because `safe = latest.saturating_sub(depth) <= latest_number` (`blocks.rs:246`) and every restart resets `number = safe` (`blocks.rs:325`); `blocks.rs:457` — guarded by `len > max_reorg_depth` on the line above; `events.rs:97-98` — `NonZeroU64::new` on the literals 100 and 3; `events.rs:342` — `div_ceil(2)` of a value ≥ 1 is ≥ 1.
9. **Indexing/slicing on RPC-supplied values can panic.** Rejected: the only index expression in my files is `&self.recent[last_index]` (`blocks.rs:502`) whose index comes from `rposition` over the same deque; `block_retry_delays.get(index).copied` (`blocks.rs:406`) is bounds-checked; `page_size.get - 1` (`events.rs:310`) is on a `NonZeroU64`. No slicing of RPC byte payloads happens in `index/`; ABI decoding is delegated to alloy (assumption A6, class `I` territory).
10. **Integer casts on RPC-supplied values truncate.** Rejected for the casts: `self.recent.len as u64` (`blocks.rs:453`) widens; `.as_millis as u64` (`clock.rs:37`) truncates only past ~584 million years; `EthRpcErrorCode::ResourceNotFound.code as i64` (`index/mod.rs:140`) widens a small constant. **Not** rejected for the unchecked _arithmetic_ on RPC timestamps (`blocks.rs:414`, `427`, `525`, `541`, `549`) — written up in F-CORE-008, together with the fact that `Cargo.toml` defines no `[profile]`, so debug panics and release wraps.
11. **Unbounded memory in the retained-header window or the log buffers.** Rejected for the log buffers: every fetch is per-block or per-page and the result is consumed immediately (`events.rs:402-469`); `queue` is bounded by `max_reorg_depth + 2` by construction. **Not** rejected for `recent`: it is bounded by `max_reorg_depth`, which is an unvalidated `u64` — F-CORE-009, case 2. Also note `BlockUpdate::New` and `Step::Block` each carry a 256-byte `Bloom` (`blocks.rs:102-106`, `events.rs:190-195`), which the `#[allow(clippy::large_enum_variant)]` comments acknowledge; that is a constant factor, not growth.
12. **The bloom integrity check could be wrong (parity with the header bloom).** Rejected as a correctness claim: `compute_logs_bloom` is `alloy::primitives::logs_bloom` (`bloom.rs:38-40`), a dependency whose internals are not on disk (A6 ⇒ class `I`). The dual-`sha2` note in `state/baseline.md` §6 is irrelevant here — the bloom is keccak-based and no SHA-256 is involved anywhere in `index/`; `grep -rn "sha2\|Sha256" crates/core/src/index/` returns nothing. Recorded as observation O-3 that the _production_ function is never anchored against a real header bloom by any test (the Gnosis vector at `bloom.rs:72-522` exercises `Bloom::accrue_raw_log` directly, and the two `use_client_filtering` tests compute both sides of the equality with `compute_logs_bloom` itself, so they cannot detect a divergence).
13. **`ObservabilityTransport` leaks secrets into logs.** Rejected: `provider/mod.rs:86-94` traces the JSON-RPC request and response at `trace` level. The payloads are chain data and signed, already-public transactions; the signer key never crosses the transport. Recorded as observation O-4 (volume, not confidentiality).
14. **The cached `chain_id` can go stale and mis-sign transactions.** Rejected as a _core-index_ finding: `provider/mod.rs:135` reads it once and `get_chain_id` returns the cache (`163-165`), which is the point — it prevents per-transaction RPC calls. An endpoint silently switching chains is undetected, but nothing in `index/` consumes `chain_id` except `BlockTime::resolve` at startup (`blocks.rs:205`). This is analysis H17 (no chain-id binding of the database) and belongs with R2/R10; recorded as observation O-5.
15. **Cancel-safety of `Watcher::next` under the driver's `select!`.** Rejected. `blocks.rs:387-389` returns queued updates before any await; `index/mod.rs:93-95` has no await between `blocks.next` resolving and `on_block_update`; `events.rs:324-325` and `382-383` assign `self.step` only after `fetch_logs` completes; `blocks.rs:504-533` mutates only after its await. The only state a dropped future can leave behind is `pending.timestamp_ms += block_time` (`blocks.rs:414`), which delays the next poll by one block time — cosmetic.
16. **`start_block` inside the reorg window double-emits or skips.** Rejected: the filter at `blocks.rs:345-358` emits exactly the recent blocks `>= start_block`, and `only_emits_blocks_at_or_after_start_block_inside_reorg_window` (`blocks.rs:787-809`) and `does_not_warp_when_start_block_is_within_reorg_window` (`blocks.rs:760-785`) assert both edges. **Not** rejected for `start_block > latest`, which is silently ignored — F-CORE-009, case 3.
17. **`max_reorg_depth = 0` lets a warp cover an uncleable block.** Confirmed as behaviour (`supports_no_reorg_protection`, `blocks.rs:811-837`, warps to `safe == latest`, contradicting the comment at `blocks.rs:268-270`) but rejected as a defect: at depth 0 the operator has declared no block mutable, and any later reorg is caught by `blocks.rs:435-439`. Noted inside F-CORE-005's "Considered and rejected".
18. **`check_logs_limit` is missing on the `ClientFiltered` path.** Confirmed (`events.rs:441-466` never calls it) but rejected as a separate finding: a truncated response removes bloom bits, so the equality check at `events.rs:450` catches it more strongly than a count threshold would. Mentioned inside F-CORE-002.
19. **`Filter::at_block_hash` vs `from_block`/`to_block` encoding could be wrong.** Not assessable offline: `alloy` 2.0.5 sources are not on disk (A6). Class `I`, no finding. Listed here so the Coverage Critic knows it was considered and why it was dropped.

---

### 7. Observations (plausible, below the finding bar)

- **O-1 — `UnexpectedBlockInvalidation` would deadlock the `-32001` recovery if it were ever reachable.** See rejected hypothesis 2. The failure mode is a permanent loop, not a crash, and the argument that it cannot happen is a case analysis over queue shapes rather than an assertion in code. A cheap hardening would be to make `Watcher::next_logs` tolerate `UnexpectedBlockInvalidation` (the block watcher has already been rewound at that point, so the correct action is to return `Ok(None)` and let `blocks.next` deliver the queued `Uncle`), or to `debug_assert!` the hash equality inside `revalidate_last_block`. Recommended for the Critic to re-derive independently.
- **O-2 — `Events::topics` does not de-duplicate.** `events.rs:569-575`. Latent: two watched ABIs sharing an event signature would make `MultipleQueries` return every matching log twice and turn a transient RPC failure into a `BadUpdate` fail-stop. The crate's own test fixture `TokenEvents` (`events.rs:632-638`) has exactly this shape (`Erc20::Transfer` and `Erc721::Transfer` share `Transfer(address,address,uint256)`), so the hazard is one `watcher_events!` edit away. No service is affected today.
- **O-3 — the production bloom function is never anchored against a real header bloom.** `bloom.rs:72-522` validates `Bloom::accrue_raw_log` against Gnosis block 45195961, not `compute_logs_bloom`; `events.rs:932` and `1361` compute the expected value with `compute_logs_bloom` itself, so a divergence between `alloy::primitives::logs_bloom` and the header's accumulation rule would pass every test and reject every block in production. A one-line test asserting `compute_logs_bloom(<the 45195961 logs>) == <that block's header bloom>` would close it.
- **O-4 — `trace`-level RPC logging is unbounded in volume.** `provider/mod.rs:86-94` formats the full request and response JSON of every call. The integration scripts enable `safenet_core=trace` (`scripts/lib/shared_test_scripts.sh:156`), so an operator copying that setting would log every block and log batch in full. No secret exposure (the payloads are public chain data and signed transactions), so this is disk/throughput, not confidentiality.
- **O-5 — no chain-id or deployment binding anywhere on the index path.** `provider/mod.rs:135` caches the chain id and nothing persists it; `BlockTime::resolve` (`blocks.rs:34-43`) is the only consumer inside `index/`. Analysis H17; belongs with the persistence reviewers. Folded into F-CORE-001's remediation option 4 as a secondary suggestion rather than claimed separately.
- **O-6 — `fallible_events` is permanent, unmarked event loss.** `events.rs:426-436` drops a failed per-topic query's logs and the surrounding update is still committed as complete for the range. Unused by any service today (section 5), so this is a documentation issue: the `Config` doc comment (`events.rs:89-91`, "Use this to mark events as noncritical") understates it — enabling the option accepts permanent, silent loss of those events, not merely a downgrade in priority.
- **O-7 — `BlockWatcher` never checks that a returned header's `number` matches the number requested.** `blocks.rs:227-236` copies whatever the node returns and `blocks.rs:441-447` records it. A node answering `eth_getBlockByNumber(n)` with a header for a different height would corrupt `recent` and `pending`, and the state machine would then fail-stop with `BadUpdate` (`state/mod.rs:190-199`). Not filed: under A4 the RPC is not malicious, and the outcome is a fail-stop rather than silent divergence. A one-line `if block.number != number` check in `require_block` would remove the class entirely.
- **O-8 — `status.latest` reports the node's head before any of it has been processed.** `blocks.rs:376-381` derives `latest` from `pending.number - 1`, and `initialize` sets `pending` from the node's head at `blocks.rs:253` _before_ the queue of `Uncle`/`Warp`/`New` updates is drained. The driver feeds that value to `TransactionQueue::update_block_status` on the very first update (`driver.rs:240-247`), so on startup the transaction queue reconciles against a block the state machine has not reached. Whether that matters is a transaction-queue question (R3, and Manager lead M10), so it is recorded rather than claimed here.

---

### 8. Coverage gaps and caveats

- **No `E1` evidence anywhere.** Every finding is `E2` (cited code plus a concrete trigger) or, where stated, `I`. `cargo test -p safenet-core` was not run; where the Reviewer role calls for running targeted tests, the tests were read instead and what they prove (or fail to prove) is stated in the finding.
- **Dependency internals not assessable (A6).** Claims that would need `alloy` 2.0.5 sources — `Filter::at_block_hash` encoding, `EthRpcErrorCode::ResourceNotFound == -32001`, `logs_bloom` semantics, `SolEventInterface::decode_raw_log` failure conditions, and whether `ProviderCall::Ready` short-circuits every internal chain-id fetch — are marked `I` and are not the load-bearing part of any finding. The one place a decode-failure _condition_ matters (F-CORE-004) is corroborated by the crate's own test at `events.rs:750-753` rather than by reasoning about alloy.
- **Consumer-side severity deferred.** F-CORE-004 and F-CORE-006 both bottom out in the validator's dispatch. I re-read `validator/src/state/mod.rs:400-470` to confirm the mechanism, but the validator's severity call is R6's (VAL-H2) and the driver's retry/exit policy is R2's (CORE-H3, M9). The findings say so explicitly so the Critic can merge rather than double-count.
- **CORE-H12 (no RPC timeouts) not filed by me.** The mechanism is in my file — `provider/mod.rs:129-137` builds the client with only `ObservabilityLayer`, no timeout layer, no retry layer, no rate limiter — but `codebase-map.md` §9 assigns CORE-H12 to R2, whose angle is the driver's shutdown blocking. Recorded here with the citation so nothing is dropped; if R2 does not file it, the Coverage Critic should promote this line.

### 3. Findings filed

All ten are `Draft`, all in my allocated range, all written the moment they were drafted.

| ID | Title (short) | Severity (mine) | Self-estimate | Basis |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| F-CORE-030 | `Driver::run` discards its outcome → every fatal error exits with status 0; `/health` is liveness-only and unused | Medium | 85% | E2 |
| F-CORE-031 | An effect is spawned only after the snapshot recording it, so a rollback onto that block reverts the resume and never re-runs the effect | Medium | 80% | E2 |
| F-CORE-032 | A panicked effect task is logged and skipped, silently removing a resume the state machine waits for | Low | 70% | E2 (no current panic trigger) |
| F-CORE-033 | Effect concurrency is unbounded: one 100-block warp page spawns a task per matching log at once | Medium | 70% | E2 |
| F-CORE-034 | Watcher errors retried at a fixed 100 ms forever with a warn line each: retry storm, log flood, deterministic errors never escalate | Medium | 80% | E2 |
| F-CORE-035 | Every RPC error is "intermittent" and swallowed forever, so a permanently failing node silently stops all onchain action while metrics keep advancing | Medium | 75% | E2 |
| F-CORE-036 | `Debug` is required on `Effect`/`Resume` and printed at `trace` in five core sinks; redaction is delegated to services and upstream | Low | 60% | E2 sinks, I disclosure |
| F-CORE-037 | Snapshots are unversioned JSON with no migration path: an upgrade bricks start-up, a downgrade silently drops fields | Low | 75% | E2 |
| F-CORE-038 | `kdf::derive_key`'s multi-part `info` is plain concatenation while the doc implies otherwise | Informational | 85% | E2 |
| F-CORE-039 | Shutdown is unbounded: the shutdown branch is unreachable during `update`, which makes un-timed RPC calls | Low | 65% | E2 driver, I timeout |

Not filed as findings but recorded below: 4 rejected leads with citations (section 4) and 11 observations (section 5).

### 4. Hypotheses considered and rejected

One entry per lead from my launch brief, the map and the analysis, plus my own ideas. Each says what refuted it.

#### 4.1 Leads from the launch brief

| Lead | Verdict | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **CORE-H3** (fatal errors exit 0) | **Confirmed → F-CORE-030.** | `driver.rs:170-198`, `crates/validator/src/main.rs:95-98`, `crates/sentinel/src/main.rs:85-88`. Extended with the `/health` half: `observability/metrics.rs:6-12` + `76-78`, and a repo-wide grep showing no consumer. |
| **CORE-H5** (replay re-queues actions with fresh nonces) | **Mechanism confirmed on my side; the duplicate-submission half is R3's.** The replay mechanism is `blocks.rs:255-266` → `state/mod.rs:182-189`; the driver re-emits commands unconditionally (`driver.rs:266-274`) and the state machine has no memory of what was already queued (only `(block_number, state)` is persisted, `state/storage.rs:49-57`). I did **not** file a duplicate-action finding: the enqueue/allocate side is `tx/storage.rs:89-104`/`145-156`, explicitly R3's scope, and R3 was running in parallel. What I found _beyond_ H5 — that replay is not symmetric, because resumes are neither replayed nor delivered — is F-CORE-031. |
| **CORE-H10** (stale resumes after rollback) | **Refuted as a defect in the current services; kept as the mirror of F-CORE-031.** Core applies a resume to whatever state exists (`state/mod.rs:250-257`), but both services key resumes by identity and reject unexpected ones: the sentinel logs and ignores a resume whose entry has moved on or vanished (`crates/sentinel/src/service.rs:156-171`, `"ignoring stale engine check result"`), and the validator's `handle_nonces` requires a matching signing session (`crates/validator/src/state/sign.rs:365-375`, read but not re-verified line by line — R5's scope). The _opposite_ direction is unguarded and is F-CORE-031. |
| **CORE-H12** (no RPC timeouts) | **Confirmed on the driver side → F-CORE-039.** `provider/mod.rs:127-137` installs only `ObservabilityLayer`. The indexing half stays with R1. The "a request can hang forever" premise is class `I` (no dependency sources on disk, `state/baseline.md` §1). |
| **CORE-H13** (wall-clock polling) | **Deferred to R1, with the mechanism confirmed by reading.** Everything is in R1's files: `index/clock.rs:31-38` (`SystemTime::now`), `index/blocks.rs:538-543` (`timestamp * 1000 + block_time`), `:548-551`. Note the harm is one-sided and self-limiting: `sleep_until` returns immediately when the target is past (`clock.rs:52-57`), so a clock _ahead_ of chain time costs only a retry, and a clock _behind_ by Δ delays polling by Δ. With working NTP, Δ is milliseconds. I file nothing to avoid duplicating R1. |
| **M9** (100 ms retries forever, no backoff) | **Confirmed → F-CORE-034**, extended with the log-flood and rate-limit-storm consequences and the handbook's contradicting backoff claim (`docs/validator-handbook.md:110`). |
| **M10** (queue reconciliation failure while the state machine advances) | **Partly refuted, partly confirmed → F-CORE-035.** M10 asks whether an action encoded against a stale chain view can be _dropped or double-submitted_: **no**. `update_block_status` stores the new status before any fallible work with an explicit comment (`tx/mod.rs:151-153`); the only branch that could be permanently skipped is the startup `unmark_executed(safe+1)`, and reaching it requires a `storage::Error`, which `is_intermittent` excludes (`tx/mod.rs:47-54`) so the driver dies instead; enqueue precedes submission (`tx/mod.rs:136`) so nothing is lost; and nonce allocation is monotonic. What survives is that the swallow is unbounded, unmetered and inconsistent with `queue_action` — filed as F-CORE-035. |
| **Core checklist 2** (fatal path → non-zero exit and unhealthy `/health`) | **Answered: neither happens.** F-CORE-030. |
| **Core checklist 10** (effect/resume semantics after rollback) | **Answered: a fork/epoch tag is not the gap; re-spawning is.** F-CORE-031 (loss), F-CORE-032 (task failure), CORE-H10 row above (staleness, handled). |
| **Core checklist 11** (timeouts and shutdown; no partial state observable on kill) | **Answered.** F-CORE-039 for the shutdown bound. On "no partial state": a kill between the snapshot commit (`state/mod.rs:236`) and the action enqueue (`driver.rs:277`) _is_ observable, but is repaired by the restart replay of the retained window (`blocks.rs:255-266`) — at the cost of duplicates (CORE-H5). The unrepairable partial state is the resume half: F-CORE-031. |
| **Core checklist 12** (SQLite configuration) | **Mostly unanswerable offline; one finding, two observations.** `connect_sqlite` sets only `idle_timeout(None)`/`max_lifetime(None)` (`utils.rs:56-62`) with a thorough rationale comment; every other pragma (`journal_mode`, `synchronous`, `busy_timeout`, `create_if_missing`, `foreign_keys`, pool size) is a sqlx 0.9 default that **cannot be read in this checkout** (A6) — so I make no claim about them. What I could check: `SQLITE_BUSY` in `commit` would be fatal (`storage::Error::Database` → `state::Error` → `driver.rs:193-196`), effect tasks share the driver's pool (`crates/validator/src/service/mod.rs:50`), and the DSN comes verbatim from operator config (`crates/validator/src/config.rs:28`), so an operator can silently weaken durability (`?synchronous=off`). Observations O-6, O-7. |
| **Core checklist 14** (secrets in `snapshots.state`) | **Answered, and widened.** The validator persists burned nonces and DKG material inside the state JSON — plaintext at rest, which the handbook documents (`docs/validator-handbook.md:75-79`) and A1 accepts, so no finding on storage. The _unaccepted_ exposure is the trace sinks: F-CORE-036. |

#### 4.2 My own hypotheses, rejected with citations

| # | Hypothesis | Why rejected |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | `EffectManager::next` is not cancel-safe: the resume is taken from the `JoinSet` and could be dropped if the select's other branch wins. | Refuted. `join_next.await` is the only await; on `Some(Ok(resume))` the function returns through a synchronous `tracing::trace!` with no intervening await (`effects.rs:76-80`), so a cancelled future has consumed nothing. The `None => future::pending.await` branch cannot lose anything either. Pinned by the crate's own test `next_is_cancel_safe` (`effects.rs:165-179`). |
| 2 | The unbiased inner select (`driver.rs:227-230`) can starve or drop a watcher update when effects complete continuously. | Refuted for _loss_: dropping the `update` future leaves the queued `BlockUpdate` in the watcher, and `Watcher::next` returns queued updates before doing I/O (`index/mod.rs:85-97`, R1's scope, read not audited). Starvation is theoretically possible under a permanent resume storm but each resume is itself produced by an effect that a block update spawned, so it is self-limiting. Recorded as observation O-3 rather than a finding. |
| 3 | `prune(block_status.safe)` can delete the snapshot a later `Uncle` needs (`MissingSnapshot` → fatal). | Refuted. Three guards line up: `prune` never deletes the newest row (`state/storage.rs:151-159`); the driver prunes with the _pre-update_ watcher status and `handle_update` runs first (`driver.rs:255-257`), so a rollback resolves before pruning; and the watcher never uncles at or below its own `safe` (`index/blocks.rs:435-439`, R1's). The warp edge case — where pruning leaves exactly one snapshot — is covered by the existing test `warps_and_prunes_intermediate_snapshots` (`state/mod.rs:584-643`) and by the `uncle <= indexed.latest` guard at `blocks.rs:262-266`. |
| 4 | A restart could prune the resume anchor before the synthetic uncle is applied, since the watcher's `safe` on a fresh start can be far above every persisted snapshot. | Refuted by ordering: the uncle is the first queued update (`blocks.rs:262-266` pushes it before the warp), `handle_update` runs before `prune` (`driver.rs:255-257`), and after the rollback `MIN == MAX`, which `prune`'s `block_number < (SELECT MAX(...))` clause protects. |
| 5 | `metrics::rpc_requests_total`'s `method` label is attacker-influenced → unbounded Prometheus cardinality. | Refuted. The label is taken from the _request_ we construct, not from any response: `request.method.to_owned` (`provider/mod.rs:70-76`), and the response only flips the `result` label (`provider/mod.rs:95-114`). Cardinality is bounded by the ~8 methods core calls. |
| 6 | `crate::metrics::initialize`'s `tokio::spawn` (`metrics.rs:89`) panics when called outside a runtime. | Refuted. Its only caller is `observability::init` (`observability/mod.rs:56-62`), and all three binaries call that inside `#[tokio::main]` (`crates/{validator,sentinel,sentinel-engine}/src/main.rs:32-45`). |
| 7 | The double `initialize` in the validator (`observability::init` → `crate::metrics::initialize`, then `main.rs:42`) spawns the tokio-metrics reporter twice. | Refuted: `main.rs:42` calls the _validator's_ `metrics::initialize`, a different module; core's runs once. |
| 8 | `serialization::from_str`'s `de::Error::custom` puts a secret into an error message when a config value fails to parse. | Refuted. Its three uses are the SQLite DSN (`crates/validator/src/config.rs:28`, `crates/sentinel/src/config.rs:25`) and the log filter (`observability/mod.rs:21`). The signer key uses a hand-written `Deserialize` that zeroizes the buffer and never echoes it (`tx/signer.rs:84-94`). |
| 9 | `storage::Error`'s `Display`/`Debug` leaks snapshot contents (which hold validator secrets). | Refuted. `Serialization(#[from] serde_json::Error)` carries a fixed message (`state/storage.rs:23-25`); `serde_json::Error` reports a category and position, not content. `MissingSnapshot(u64)` prints a block number. |
| 10 | The `Mutex<Option<(S, Status)>>` in `StateMachine` (`state/mod.rs:102`) can deadlock or be contended across an await. | Refuted as a liveness issue: every caller of `handle_update`/`handle_resume` holds `&mut self`, and `block_status`/`prune` do not take the lock at all. The lock is redundant, not dangerous. The `mem::take` poisoning it enables is observation O-1. |
| 11 | `utils::shutdown_signal`'s two `unwrap`s (`utils.rs:20`, `:26`) are a reachable panic. | Refuted in practice: `signal` fails only outside a runtime or on resource exhaustion, and the only caller is `Driver::run` inside `#[tokio::main]`. Recorded as O-8 because it is a panic in a `pub` utility that a future caller could hit. |
| 12 | The `/health` + metrics listener's port-race retry (`observability/metrics.rs:26-41`) can leave the global recorder installed but no listener, or loop. | Refuted as a silent failure: three attempts, then the error is returned and `observability::init` propagates it, so start-up fails loudly. The dropped errors inside `if let Ok(...)` cost diagnostics only — observation O-9. |
| 13 | Warp `seen` metric jumping to the warp target misreports progress. | Rejected as intended: `Update::Block(Warp{to})` sets `seen` to `to` (`driver.rs:304`), which matches the documented meaning ("the update was received from the chain watcher") while `processed` only moves on a committed log range. Consistent with `Driver::new`'s restore (`driver.rs:136-141`). |

### 5. Observations (plausible but below the 40% bar — not findings)

| # | Observation | Citation | Why it is not a finding |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| O-1 | **State-machine poisoning.** `handle_update`/`handle_resume` `mem::take` the state before doing fallible work, so _any_ error — including the `_ => return Err(Error::BadUpdate)` arm, which returns before restoring — leaves `inner = None` and every later call returns `Poisoned`. The state value is dropped, so no recovery is possible even in principle. | `state/mod.rs:170-171`, `:240-242`, `:252` | Moot for the only caller: the driver exits on the first error. It is a latent hazard for any other consumer of this `pub` API, and it makes a "retry the update" fix impossible without restructuring. |
| O-2 | **A resume is applied while the machine is `Initialized` or mid-warp** — `handle_resume` ignores `Status` entirely, so a resume can mutate state that has never seen a block. | `state/mod.rs:250-257` | Unreachable today (effects only exist after a transition), but nothing enforces it. |
| O-3 | **Resume starvation of the watcher** under a continuous effect-completion stream, because the inner select is unbiased. | `driver.rs:227-230` | Self-limiting: resumes are only produced by effects that block updates spawned. Worth one line of reasoning in a comment. |
| O-4 | **Effects are spawned before their sibling actions are queued** (`spawn` happens inside the command loop, `queue` after it), so an effect can observe the world before the action that the same transition emitted is even enqueued. | `driver.rs:266-284` | Contract-compatible (effects are replayable and ordering is undefined), but it is an ordering a service author could easily assume the other way round. |
| O-5 | **`Driver::new` reads `state.block_status` before the watcher exists**, so the snapshot bounds handed to `Watcher::new` are already stale by however long the watcher's own initialisation scan takes. | `driver.rs:129-134` | Harmless: the state machine cannot advance during `new`. Noted because the two `BlockStatus` values in this code mean different things (retained-snapshot bounds vs chain view) and share a type. |
| O-6 | **Every durability-critical SQLite pragma is a sqlx default that this run cannot read.** `connect_sqlite` sets only the two recycling knobs. A `SQLITE_BUSY` during `commit` is fatal (`driver.rs:193-196`), and effect tasks share the driver's pool in the validator. | `utils.rs:38-62`; `crates/validator/src/service/mod.rs:50` | Class `I` throughout (A6, `state/baseline.md` §1). QA with a toolchain should confirm `journal_mode=WAL`, `synchronous=FULL`, `busy_timeout` and `foreign_keys` empirically — a five-line test. |
| O-7 | **The DSN is operator-supplied verbatim**, so `?synchronous=off`, `?journal_mode=memory` or a `mode=ro` file silently changes durability or breaks writes. Conversely the sample configs omit `mode=rwc` while the test harness adds it, so a first run against the shipped sample may fail to create the database. | `utils.rs:56-62`; `crates/validator/validator.sample.toml:21`; `crates/sentinel/sentinel.sample.toml:21`; `scripts/lib/shared_test_scripts.sh:142` | Under A1 the operator is trusted, and the `create_if_missing` default is a sqlx claim I cannot verify offline. Flagged for R6/R7, who own the sample files. |
| O-8 | **Two `unwrap`s in a `pub` shutdown helper** panic if signal registration fails. | `utils.rs:17-29` | Unreachable from the current callers (O-11 in §4.2). |
| O-9 | **The metrics listener's retry loop discards its errors**, so a genuine bind failure is reported only by the third attempt's error. | `observability/metrics.rs:36-41` | Diagnostics only; start-up still fails loudly. |
| O-10 | **`/health` is undocumented.** Neither handbook nor `docs/sentinel-engine.md` mentions it, and nothing in the repository probes it, so operators are unlikely to wire it up even once it means something. | repo-wide grep for `health` over Dockerfiles/scripts/manifests returns nothing; `docs/*.md` mention only `metrics_address` | Documentation, and it becomes relevant only if F-CORE-030's remediation 3 is taken. |
| O-11 | **`block_number` gauges are `f64`**, and `Driver::new` restores both `seen` and `processed` from the same persisted `latest`. | `driver.rs:136-141`, `:307-316`; `metrics.rs:62-70` | Precision is irrelevant below 2^53; the restore is correct because `MAX(snapshots)` is by definition the last fully processed block. |

### 6. Coverage statement

- Every one of the twelve assigned files was read end to end, including test modules. Nothing was skipped, sampled or skimmed.
- Nothing was executed: no `cargo`, no tests, no scripts, no network (A9 FALSE — see `state/baseline.md` §2). Every basis row in my findings is `E2` or `I`; none is `E1`, and none claims 90%+.
- Files outside my scope are cited only as _related_ locations, and section 1 lists exactly which parts of them I read. Where a mechanism lives in another reviewer's file (CORE-H13 in `index/`, the duplicate-action half of CORE-H5 in `tx/`), I recorded the analysis in section 4 and did not file a competing finding.
- Two claims in my findings rest on dependency behaviour that is not on disk and are marked `I`: what `frost-core`'s `Debug` prints (F-CORE-036) and whether an un-timed HTTP request can hang indefinitely (F-CORE-039). Both are one command away for an agent with a toolchain.

### Findings filed

| ID | Title | Severity (reviewer) | Self-estimate |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| F-CORE-060 | Underpriced-rejection fee ratchet is unbounded, runs every block, and bypasses `priority_fee_cap_percentage` | High | 75% |
| F-CORE-061 | `is_transaction_underpriced` only matches _replacement_ rejections; a first-submission fee rejection retries at an unchanged fee forever and blocks every later nonce | Medium | 60% |
| F-CORE-062 | An allocated nonce is never released and allocation is floored at `MAX(nonce)+1`, so a single bad nonce permanently wedges the queue with no error, metric or recovery path | High | 55% |
| F-CORE-063 | Execution is inferred from the account nonce alone and invalidated only by a block-number regression, so a transaction can be marked executed, pruned and silently lost | Medium | 60% |
| F-CORE-064 | `expires_at` is silently void once a nonce is allocated, contradicting the queue's documented contract; deadline-bearing actions can land arbitrarily late | Medium | 70% |
| F-CORE-065 | No chain-id or deployment binding on `transactions`, and `Provider::chain_id` is cached at connect so an endpoint chain change is undetectable | Low | 65% |
| F-CORE-066 | `tx::Config` accepts values that silently disable the queue: `blocks_before_resubmit = 0`, `max_in_flight_transactions = 0`, `priority_fee_cap_percentage = nan`/negative | Medium | 75% |

### Hypotheses considered and rejected

Leads from `analysis-core.md` §11 and the checklist that fall in my scope, plus my own, each with the citation that settles it.

1. **CORE-H6 (fee bumps compound without a ceiling; the cap does not apply to bumps)** — **CONFIRMED and escalated**, filed as `F-CORE-060`. The analysis put the rate at "one bump per `blocks_before_resubmit` blocks" and rated it 55%/Medium. That understates it: an _underpriced_ rejection records `submitted_at = NULL` (`tx/mod.rs:277-282` passes `block: None`; `tx/storage.rs:174-196` binds it as SQL `NULL`), and `stale_submissions` selects `submitted_at IS NULL` unconditionally (`tx/storage.rs:296-297`), so such a transaction is rebuilt **every** advancing block, not every second block. The crate's own test proves the per-block rate: fees go 231/11 at block 12 to 255/13 at block 13 (`tx/mod.rs:703-717`).

2. **CORE-H7 (first-submission "transaction underpriced" and non-geth messages unrecognised)** — **mechanism CONFIRMED**, filed as `F-CORE-061`. The regex pair at `tx/mod.rs:362-368` requires "replacement transaction" _and_ "underpriced", so any message lacking the word "replacement" takes the generic branch at `tx/mod.rs:287-293`, which does not call `record_submission`; the row is then rebuilt with `bump(fresh, None) == fresh` (`types.rs:64-66`, `fees.rs:39-42`). The _exact wording_ other clients emit cannot be verified offline (no dependency or client sources on disk), so that half stays class `I` and the finding is scoped to the code path, not to a named client string.

3. **CORE-H11 (nonce reconciliation under inconsistent/forked RPC views)** — **split into two findings.** The "silently dropped action" half is `F-CORE-063`; the "permanent gap" half is `F-CORE-062`. Both are real code properties (no sanity check exists anywhere: `tx/storage.rs:144-156` and `224-235` consume `status.nonce` unvalidated). The trigger for each remains class `I` because it needs an RPC that reports an account nonce inconsistent with the block stream, which A4 permits but which I cannot demonstrate offline.

4. **Concurrent nonce-allocation race** — **rejected.** `TransactionQueue` methods all take `&mut self` (`tx/mod.rs:132, 145, 204, 224, 241, 300, 322`) and the driver owns it by value on a single task; allocation is one atomic `UPDATE … RETURNING` (`tx/storage.rs:144-161`). Agrees with the analysis.

5. **Two live rows can hold the same nonce (so `record_submission`'s `WHERE nonce = ?` would update both, and two payloads would race for one nonce)** — **rejected.** Allocation is `MAX(?, COALESCE((SELECT MAX(nonce) + 1 FROM transactions), 0))` (`tx/storage.rs:145-149`). Whenever the passed chain nonce is at or below an existing nonce, `MAX(nonce)+1` strictly exceeds every existing nonce and wins; whenever it is above, it is above every existing nonce. So no live row can collide with another live row. A collision with an _already pruned_ row is possible (that is `F-CORE-062`), but a pruned row no longer exists, so `record_submission` still touches exactly one row. `record_submission` therefore cannot silently update two rows.

6. **`bump` can produce `max_priority_fee_per_gas > max_fee_per_gas` (an invalid EIP-1559 transaction)** — **rejected.** `bump_fee` (`fees.rs:53-56`) is monotone non-decreasing in `previous` and takes `max(fresh, …)` per component. Given `F_max >= F_prio` for a fresh estimate and `P_max >= P_prio` for the stored pair, `max(F_max, b(P_max)) >= max(F_prio, b(P_prio))`. The stored pair is itself always an output of `bump` or of `cap_priority_fee`, and `cap_priority_fee` returns `max_fee = base_fee + max_priority_fee_per_gas` with `base_fee >= 0` (`fees.rs:27-30`), so the invariant is preserved inductively. Agrees with the analysis.

7. **Overflow or division-by-zero in `cap_priority_fee`** — **rejected.** `scaled_percent >= PRECISION` returns early (`fees.rs:17-19`) so the divisor `PRECISION - scaled_percent` is strictly positive; `saturating_sub`/`saturating_mul` guard the rest; and the unchecked `base_fee + max_priority_fee_per_gas` at `fees.rs:29` cannot overflow because `base_fee = max_fee.saturating_sub(prio)` and `max_priority_fee_per_gas = prio.min(capped) <= prio`, so the sum is at most the original `max_fee_per_gas`. (The _semantic_ behaviour on `NaN`/negative input is a separate issue, filed as `F-CORE-066`.)

8. **Overflow in `bump_fee`** — **rejected as a panic**, but noted: `previous.saturating_add(previous.div_ceil(10))` (`fees.rs:54`) saturates at `u128::MAX` instead of erroring. It cannot panic, but it also means the ratchet in `F-CORE-060` has no arithmetic ceiling at all — the value simply pins at `u128::MAX`. Recorded as part of `F-CORE-060` rather than separately.

9. **Double execution after a crash between `eth_sendRawTransaction` and `record_submission`** — **rejected**, and I re-derived it independently rather than taking the analysis's word. The durable-write order in `submit_transaction` is: nonce allocated and committed by `next_transaction` (`tx/storage.rs:144-161`) → sign (pure, `signer.rs:41-48`) → broadcast (`tx/mod.rs:265`) → `record_submission` (`tx/mod.rs:266`). A crash at any point leaves the row present with its nonce; `stale_submissions` re-selects it because `submitted_at IS NULL` (`tx/storage.rs:296-297`); the rebuild reuses `self.nonce` from the same row (`types.rs:64-69`). Two broadcasts of the same nonce can exist, but at most one can be included. Nothing is lost, because `prune` never deletes a row with a nonce and no `executed_at` (`tx/storage.rs:250, 259-262`). **The tx-queue write ordering is sound in both directions.**

10. **A crash between `record_submission` succeeding and the next step** — **rejected**: `record_submission` is the last durable write in the sequence (`tx/mod.rs:265-266`); there is no later state to lose.

11. **`Error::NonceNotFound` (fatal, since `storage::Error` is not intermittent — `tx/mod.rs:47-54`) reachable during normal operation** — **rejected.** The only writer that could delete a row between the read and the write is `prune`, which runs earlier in `update_block_status` (`tx/mod.rs:162-164`) and never inside `resubmit_stale`/`submit_pending`. All calls are on one `&mut self` task. I could not construct a reachable path.

12. **`nonce` falling back to the `latest` block tag, opening a race with the block watcher's view** — **rejected as unreachable.** `BlockId::latest` (`tx/mod.rs:307`) is only used when `self.block_status` is `None`, but `queue` guards on `if let Some(status) = self.block_status` (`tx/mod.rs:137-139`) and `update_block_status` assigns `self.block_status = Some(status)` at `tx/mod.rs:153` before any call to `nonce` at line 188 or 207. Dead branch. Pinning the nonce query to `block_status.latest` is in fact a deliberate strengthening, and it means a _lagging_ single backend cannot silently answer with a stale count (it must error on an unknown header) — this is why `F-CORE-062`/`063` are scoped to _inconsistent_ rather than merely _lagging_ views.

13. **`submit_pending` exceeding `max_in_flight_transactions`** — **rejected.** `count_in_flight` is read once and the loop runs exactly `max_in_flight - in_flight` times (`tx/mod.rs:205-216`), each iteration allocating at most one nonce. Re-entry through `queue` (`tx/mod.rs:136-139`) re-reads `count_in_flight`. The cap holds. (Its _interaction_ with wedged rows is `F-CORE-062`.)

14. **`prune` deleting a row that a reorg could still resurrect** — **rejected within A5.** `prune` uses `safe` for both deletions (`tx/storage.rs:245-268`) and `safe` is the watcher's out-of-window anchor (`index/blocks.rs:109-116, 376-381`). Under A5 a reorg deeper than `max_reorg_depth` is a deliberate exit, so `safe` is a sound cut-off. The comment at `tx/storage.rs:241-244` states this intent correctly.

15. **Startup reconciliation being skipped because `self.block_status` is assigned before the fallible work** — **rejected.** `self.block_status = Some(status)` at `tx/mod.rs:153` does precede `prune`/`unmark_executed`, so an early failure would move `previous` off `None` and permanently skip the `None => status.safe.checked_add(1)` branch (`tx/mod.rs:167-179`). But every statement between line 153 and the `unmark_executed` call is local or SQLite, and a SQLite error is _not_ intermittent (`tx/mod.rs:47-54`), so the driver exits (`driver.rs:248`) rather than continuing with a half-applied startup. The first RPC call (`nonce`, line 188) comes _after_ `unmark_executed`. So the ordering is safe by construction, though only accidentally.

16. **An intermittent RPC failure at `nonce` losing a block's reconciliation permanently** — **rejected.** The failure returns `Error::Rpc`, which the driver logs and swallows (`driver.rs:247-253`). `self.block_status` is already advanced, but the gate at `tx/mod.rs:185` is `previous.latest < status.latest`, so the _next_ advancing block re-runs `mark_executed`/`resubmit_stale`/`submit_pending`. The loss is one block of latency, not permanent.

17. **`SignedTransaction::hash` computing a wrong transaction hash** — **rejected.** `keccak256(self.0.as_slice)` over `tx.into_signed(signature).encoded_2718` (`signer.rs:46, 69-71`) is exactly the EIP-2718 typed-transaction hash. It is also only used in a `tracing::debug!` field (`tx/mod.rs:262`), so even a wrong value would be cosmetic.

18. **Private-key exposure through `Signer`** — **rejected.** `Signer` has exactly three impls: `Signer` (inherent), `Deserialize`, `Debug` (`signer.rs:28, 84, 96`). There is no `Display`, no `Serialize`, no `Into<Vec<u8>>`. `Debug` emits only the address (`signer.rs:96-100`), the deserializer zeroizes its `B256` scratch buffer (`signer.rs:89-92`), and `derive_key` zeroizes the copy it takes from the key (`signer.rs:60-63`). No `tracing` call in `tx/` takes the signer or the key. Whether alloy/k256 zeroize on drop, and whether `PrivateKeySigner::to_bytes` leaves an unzeroized intermediate, is unverifiable offline (A6) — see Observation O4.

19. **`Signer: Clone` (`signer.rs:22-23`) duplicating key material** — **not a finding.** Under A1 the host is trusted, the sentinel's clone is a single startup-time copy, and there is no way to bound library-internal copies without the sources (A6). Recorded as Observation O4.

20. **`derive_key` chain/domain confusion** — **rejected for `tx/`.** `Signer::derive_key` delegates to `kdf::derive_key(ikm, domain, &[message])` with the caller supplying a constant domain (`signer.rs:59-64`). Its only production consumer is outside my scope. The `kdf` info-concatenation ambiguity is CORE-H16 and belongs to whoever holds `kdf.rs`.

21. **JSON/SQL type mismatch between `json_set` and the serde attributes** — **rejected.** `json_set(request, '$.nonce', nonce)` writes an SQLite INTEGER, and `AllocatedTransaction::nonce` is a plain `u64` with no quantity adapter (`types.rs:47-49`). `record_submission` writes the fees as `format!("0x{:x}", …)` strings (`tx/storage.rs:187-193`) and the fee fields use `alloy::serde::quantity::opt` (`types.rs:53-58`), which expects hex QUANTITY strings. Both sides agree. `Transaction` does not set `deny_unknown_fields` (`types.rs:18-20`), so the extra fee keys written into `request` do not break the `#[serde(flatten)]` at `types.rs:50-52`.

22. **`stale_submissions` returning already-executed transactions and re-broadcasting them** — **rejected.** The query filters `executed_at IS NULL` (`tx/storage.rs:296`).

23. **`resubmit_stale` underflow when `block < blocks_before_resubmit`** — **rejected.** `checked_sub` yields `None` (`tx/mod.rs:225`), and `stale_submissions(None)` binds the sentinel `-1` so `submitted_at <= -1` never matches (`tx/storage.rs:300-305`); only `submitted_at IS NULL` rows are returned. Intentional and correct. (This same `submitted_at IS NULL` clause is what makes `F-CORE-060` run every block.)

24. **`prune` leaving never-expiring queued rows to accumulate without bound** — **rejected as a memory issue, retained as Observation O1.** `prune` deliberately excludes `expires_at IS NULL` rows (`tx/storage.rs:255-262`, test `tx/storage.rs:488-506`), so a service that queues `expires_at: None` actions faster than they execute grows the table without bound. The sentinel does queue several `expires_at: None` actions (`crates/sentinel/src/service.rs:524, 571, 638, 667`). Growth is bounded in practice by execution throughput, so this is an observation rather than a finding.

25. **`count_outstanding` gating starving the queue** — **rejected.** `executed_at IS NULL AND (nonce IS NOT NULL OR expires_at IS NULL OR expires_at > ?)` (`tx/storage.rs:210-219`) counts every row that could still need work; a zero count genuinely means there is nothing to do, and `queue` re-enters `submit_pending` directly when new work arrives (`tx/mod.rs:136-139`).

26. **A reorg failing to unmark executed transactions** — **rejected for the observable case.** `BlockWatcher::status` derives `latest` from `pending.number - 1` (`index/blocks.rs:376-381`), and the uncle path rewinds `pending`, so `latest` really does regress and `tx/mod.rs:174` fires `unmark_executed(latest + 1)`. The case that _is not_ covered — the account nonce regressing without a block-height regression — is `F-CORE-063`.

27. **`update_block_status` skipping resubmission on the reorg status itself** — **rejected as intended.** When `previous.latest > status.latest`, the gate at `tx/mod.rs:185` is false, so unmarking happens on the reorg status and resubmission on the next advancing block. The test at `tx/mod.rs:506-522` encodes exactly this one-block delay as the expected behaviour.

28. **Checklist item 5 (replay-induced duplicate submissions, CORE-H5)** — **not mine to file.** `enqueue` is an unconditional `INSERT` with no de-duplication (`tx/storage.rs:96-100`), which I confirm, but the _replay_ half lives in `index/blocks.rs` and `state/mod.rs`. I note here only that the queue offers no de-duplication hook at all, and that `F-CORE-062`'s in-flight cap makes duplicate rows more damaging than they look (each duplicate consumes one of the 16 slots).

### Observations (plausible, below the finding bar)

- **O1 — unbounded growth of never-expiring queued rows.** `prune` never removes `expires_at IS NULL` rows that have not been allocated a nonce (`tx/storage.rs:259-262`). If a service ever queues such actions faster than the queue drains them, `transactions` grows without bound and `next_transaction`'s `ORDER BY id ASC … LIMIT 1` scan (there is **no index on any column** — the table is created with only an `INTEGER PRIMARY KEY`, `tx/storage.rs:69-80`) degrades linearly. Not currently reachable at a rate that matters.
- **O2 — no index on `nonce`, `executed_at`, `submitted_at` or `expires_at`.** Every query in `storage.rs` is a full table scan. Harmless at the expected row counts, but there is also **no `UNIQUE(nonce)` constraint**, so the invariant that rejected hypothesis 5 relies on is enforced only by the arithmetic of one SQL expression, with no database-level backstop. A `UNIQUE` index would turn `F-CORE-062`'s failure mode into a loud error.
- **O3 — the `TransactionQueue::new` doc comment is stale.** It reads "Creates a transaction queue that signs `chain_id` transactions with `signer`" (`tx/mod.rs:107-109`) but the function has no `chain_id` parameter; the chain id is read from the provider at submit time (`tx/mod.rs:246`). Cosmetic, but it is the comment that makes a reader believe the queue is chain-bound when it is not — related to `F-CORE-065`.
- **O4 — key-material copies inside dependencies.** `Signer: Clone` (`signer.rs:22-23`) and `PrivateKeySigner::to_bytes` (`signer.rs:60`) both produce copies of the secp256k1 private key. `derive_key` zeroizes the copy it can see (`signer.rs:62`), but whether alloy's `PrivateKeySigner` and k256's `SigningKey` zeroize on drop is not verifiable — those sources are not on disk (A6), so any claim here would be class `I`. Under A1 this is not a finding.
- **O5 — the underpriced branch trusts a rejection to establish a fee floor.** `record_submission` is called with the _rejected_ fees (`tx/mod.rs:277-282`), so an attempt that never reached any mempool permanently raises the queue's own floor. This is deliberate (comment at `tx/mod.rs:267-270`) and converges in the intended case, but it is the mechanism that makes `F-CORE-060` a ratchet rather than an oscillation. Recorded here so the design intent is not lost.
- **O6 — a wedged or stuck queue is invisible.** `crates/core/src/metrics.rs` exports RPC counters, block numbers and uncle counts; there is **no** metric for queue depth, in-flight count, oldest unexecuted nonce, or current fee level, and every submission failure is a `tracing::warn!` (`tx/mod.rs:272, 288`) rather than an error or a gauge. Every finding below is therefore silent to an operator watching metrics. Not filed separately because it is an absence rather than a defect; it materially raises the severity of `F-CORE-060`, `061` and `062`.
- **O7 — `is_transaction_underpriced` matches a vendor-specific string.** `INTERNAL_ERROR: could not replace existing tx` (`tx/mod.rs:366`) is a provider-specific message, not a client one. If a provider emits it for reasons unrelated to fees, the queue interprets a permanent failure as "bump and retry" — the input side of `F-CORE-060`. Folded into that finding's trigger rather than filed separately.

### Gaps and limits

- No file in my scope was left unread. No `cargo test` was run (A9 FALSE), so every claim is `E2` or `I`; the crate's existing tests were read and are cited where they demonstrate a behaviour (notably `tx/mod.rs:683-718` for the per-block fee ratchet).
- The exact rejection strings emitted by geth, Nethermind, Erigon and hosted providers cannot be checked offline: no dependency sources and no network. Every claim that depends on a specific message is marked `I` in its finding.
- alloy's `estimate_eip1559_fees` estimator (which RPC methods it issues, what it returns when `reward` is empty) is not on disk (A6), so `F-CORE-060`'s starting fee level is taken from the tests' mock (`tx/mod.rs:407-415`) rather than from the real estimator.

### Findings written

| ID | Title | Severity (reviewer) | Self-estimate |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| F-VAL-001 | No proof of possession on the DKG encryption key `q`: a participant that republishes a peer's `q` recovers that peer's complete FROST signing share while the group finalizes normally | Critical | 85% |
| F-VAL-002 | ECDH pad is an unhashed x-coordinate reused in both directions of every pair: a complaint response reveals the plaintiff's share as well as the accused's | Medium | 88% |
| F-VAL-003 | `handle_key_gen_complained` reveals a plaintext share in the sharing round with no deadline and no rate limit per plaintiff | Medium | 75% |
| F-VAL-004 | A failed or lost `KeyGenSetup` effect during genesis stalls the validator (and the network's bootstrap) forever: no deadline, no timeout arm, no retry | High | 80% |

### Hypotheses considered

#### Confirmed (promoted to findings)

- **VAL-H1 / checklist 1 — no PoP on `q`.** Confirmed and strengthened. The analysis's chain (`analysis-validator.md:231-247`) assumed the attacker publishes shares it cannot encrypt and is therefore excluded; re-reading `state/keygen.rs:660-712` shows complaints are also accepted in `RolloverState::CollectingShares` with **no deadline guard at all**, so the attacker can harvest every pad _before_ publishing its own share and then publish a fully valid one. The group finalizes with the attacker inside and undetected. → **F-VAL-001**.
- **VAL-H5 / M2 / M3 — two-time pad, raw x-coordinate, doc drift.** Confirmed by `frost/ecdh.rs:110-121` + the crate's own `ecdh_is_commutative` test (`ecdh.rs:154-163`), `frost/keygen.rs:196-214` and `353-386`, against `docs/overview.md:48`. → **F-VAL-002**.
- **Checklist 7 — complaint-flow policy.** `state/keygen.rs:734-745` responds unconditionally; the `CollectingShares` arm has no deadline; the threshold is counted per accused only (`714-731`). → **F-VAL-003** (the parts not already inside F-VAL-001).
- **VAL-H4 / checklist 3 — a lost `KeyGenSetup` resume during genesis stalls the network.** Confirmed and strengthened. The analysis's trigger was a restart in a ~1-block window (class `I`, 55%); re-reading `service/effect.rs:126-143` and `243-255` gives a deterministic `E2` trigger that needs no crash at all — `Effect::KeyGenSetup` writes to the shared SQLite pool and **any** error is collapsed into `Resume::Noop`, while `crates/core/src/effects.rs:53-62` spawns each effect exactly once with no retry. Genesis then has no recovery arm whatsoever: all four branches of `handle_key_gen_timeouts` require a deadline (`state/keygen.rs:1003-1010`, `1027-1033`, `1047-1053`, `1070-1077`) and `handle_rollover_new_block` returns early because `EpochId::Genesis::number` is `None` (`912-921`, `consensus/epoch.rs:39-45`). → **F-VAL-004**. Observation O1 is superseded by this finding.

#### Rejected, with the citation that refutes each

- **M1 — replayed keygen reuses the same key and produces the same ciphertexts / can two different share values ever be padded with the same `(sk_me, q_peer)` pad through replay?** **Refuted for the replay path.** `store_keygen_secrets` has exactly one non-test caller, `service/effect.rs:135-138`, reached only from `Effect::KeyGenSetup { group_id, .. }`, which is emitted at exactly one site, `state/keygen.rs:1149-1153` in `start_key_gen`, with `group_id = group.id`. The row is therefore keyed by the ceremony's group id (`secrets/store.rs:105-124`, insert-only). Within one group id: `sk_me` and the polynomial are fixed by that row; `q_peer` is fixed because `FROSTParticipantMap.register` (`contracts/src/libraries/FROSTParticipantMap.sol:146-148`) requires `state.status == ParticipantStatus.NONE`, so a peer publishes exactly one commitment (hence one `q`) per group id; `id_peer` is fixed by the address (`frost/participants.rs:16-19`). Same pad **and** same plaintext ⇒ byte-identical ciphertext, which is a replay, not a two-time pad. Across group ids: `restart_key_gen_excluding` (`state/keygen.rs:1188-1225`) always removes at least one address from the set, so the participants Merkle root and `count` change (`consensus/group.rs:140-160,244-264`) and the group id changes, giving a fresh row and a fresh `EncryptionKey::generate` (`frost/keygen.rs:54`). The PR #851 recovery path (`state/keygen.rs:997-1024`) explicitly does **not** restart when no participant is missing to exclude — it skips the epoch — precisely to avoid recomputing an identical group. So no two _different_ share values are ever padded with the same `(sk_me, q_peer)` pad via replay or restart. _(Store-internal properties of `store_keygen_secrets` — the `ON CONFLICT … DO UPDATE SET secrets = keygen_secrets.secrets` idiom, JSON-at-rest, zeroisation of the returned `String` — are `secrets/store.rs` and therefore R5's; I read them only for this trace and file no finding on them.)_ **Same-pad-two-plaintexts does exist, but from a different cause:** two peers publishing the _same_ `q` in one ceremony make `me` encrypt `f_me(P1)` and `f_me(P2)` under the identical pad (`frost/keygen.rs:196-214`). That is peer-controlled, not replay-controlled, and is covered by F-VAL-001/F-VAL-002.
- **VAL-H7 — `ReconcileGroupSecrets` races the same block's store writes.** `service/effect.rs` and `state/mod.rs` command ordering are R6's files; the only part in my scope is that `Effect::KeyGenSetup` and `Effect::NonceTree` are emitted from Logs transitions (`state/keygen.rs:1149-1153`, `1320`) and `Effect::StartNonceGeneration` from `confirm_key_gen` (`1352-1355`). I could not construct a deterministic interleaving from my files alone. Recorded as **Observation O2**; left to R6.
- **VAL-H9 — late-complaint asymmetry excludes the honest plaintiff.** Partly refuted as stated. The analysis cites `state/keygen.rs:692-695` for "complaints after `deadlines.complain` are ignored"; the guard is real (`692-695`: `block <= deadlines.complain`), but the analysis missed that the **`CollectingShares` arm (`662-684`) has no deadline guard**, so a complaint filed before the share round closes is always processed. The residual case — a complaint filed onchain after `deadlines.complain` while the local state is `CollectingConfirmations` — is real: the accused never queues a response (`711` returns early), the plaintiff cannot confirm onchain (`FROSTParticipantMap.sol:219-222` requires `state.complaints == 0`), and the confirm-deadline branch (`1087-1090`) then excludes the plaintiff. Impact is one wasted DKG round plus the exclusion of a possibly-honest validator; every honest node computes the same deadlines from event block numbers, so there is no consensus divergence. Folded into **F-VAL-003** as the deadline-asymmetry half rather than filed separately.
- **Threshold / participant-set arithmetic off-by-one (checklist 8).** Refuted. `min_participants` (`consensus/group.rs:227-240`) computes `max(2, 2N/3 + 1)` in `u32` and is compared against the **post-exclusion** count while `N` is the **pre-exclusion** epoch set (`177-217`, esp. `206-212`), which is exactly "strictly more than two thirds of the epoch's default set" as documented at `1-38`. Hand-checked N = 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,9: `2N/3+1` is the least integer strictly greater than `2N/3` in every case. Empty and singleton sets are rejected (`min_participants(0) = min_participants(1) = 2 > count`), so `MerkleTree::build` is never called with an empty leaf set from this path. `group_threshold = count/2 + 1` (`220-222`) is a strict majority for every `count` (test `330-335`), and the contract independently requires `count >= threshold && threshold > 1` (`FROSTCoordinator.sol:347`).
- **Group id / context / participant-leaf encoding vs Solidity (A7).** Refuted. `group_id` (`consensus/group.rs:252-264`) is `keccak256` over four 32-byte words with the two `uint16`s right-aligned at `[62..64]` and `[94..96]`, then `id.0[24..].fill(0)`; this is byte-for-byte `FROSTGroupId.create` + `mask` (`contracts/src/libraries/FROSTGroupId.sol:36-60`, mask `0xffff…ffff0000000000000000` = clear the low 64 bits). Participant leaves are the left-padded address word (`consensus/group.rs:244-247`) matching `FROSTParticipantMap.register`'s `bytes32(uint256(uint160(participant)))` (`FROSTParticipantMap.sol:149`). `group_context` packs `(uint32 0, address, uint64)` into exactly 32 bytes (`268-277`) and has no Solidity counterpart (the contract treats `context` as opaque, `FROSTCoordinator.sol:343-354`). The `actual_group` test (`group.rs:376-458`) pins the whole derivation against a real mainnet transaction.
- **Marshal round-trip canonicality (checklist 12).** Refuted for the cases I could reach. `frost_scalar` rejects `>= n` via `Scalar::from_repr` (`marshal.rs:125-129`); `frost_point` maps `(0,0)` to the identity and otherwise builds a 65-byte uncompressed SEC1 that `k256` validates against the curve equation (`133-148`); `frost_signing_commitments` rejects identity in either commitment (`163-176`); `EncryptionPublicKey::from_point` rejects identity (`ecdh.rs:70-75`), so `commitment.q` can never be the identity even though `frost_point` allows it. The fixed-size slice writes at `140-143` and the `as_chunks::<32>` at `78-81` are over constant-length buffers (65-byte uncompressed encoding), so no panic is reachable.
- **Identity coefficient commitments accepted (`marshal.rs:136-138`).** Considered and rejected as a finding. A participant may publish `C[0] = identity` (contributing `a_0 = 0`) and still pass `verify_proof_of_knowledge`, because a Schnorr PoK over the identity is satisfiable with `mu·G = R`. It does not enable biasing the group key: the PoK forces the attacker to know `dlog(C[0])`, so it cannot choose `C[0] = kG - Σ_j C_j[0]` for an unknown `Σ_j`. With at least one honest contributor the group key stays uniform. Recorded as **Observation O3**.
- **Address→identifier collision / forgery (checklist 1).** Refuted as a practical concern. `Identifier::derive(address.as_slice)` (`frost/participants.rs:16-19`) is the ciphersuite HID over the 20-byte address, matching the contract's `FROST.identifier`. A collision would silently merge two entries in `peer_packages` (`frost/keygen.rs:499-516`, a `BTreeMap<Address, _>` folded into a `BTreeMap<Identifier, _>`) and desynchronise the encrypted-share index between `generate_secret_shares` (`196-214`) and `verify_encrypted_secret_share` (`365-374`); finding such a collision is a 128-bit birthday problem over an attacker-chosen address, which is not reachable. An identifier cannot be _forged_: the contract binds `msg.sender` into every event and the Rust derives the identifier from that address, never from attacker-supplied bytes.
- **Encrypted-share index desynchronisation between sender and receiver.** Refuted. The sender orders `commitments` (a `BTreeMap<Address, _>`, i.e. ascending address) and drops the entry whose identifier equals its own (`frost/keygen.rs:196-204`); the receiver walks the same map, drops the _sender's address_, and takes the position of its own identifier (`365-374`). These agree because the sender's own address is necessarily a key of the map (it published the commitment that put it there) and identifier derivation is injective in practice. Both sides use the map that `finalize_key_gen_commitments` built from the full commitment set (`state/keygen.rs:1247-1290`), which is only reached when `commitments.len == count` (`state/keygen.rs:196-213`), and the contract independently enforces `share.f.length == state.count - 1` (`FROSTCoordinator.sol:429-431`). An out-of-range index returns `IncorrectNumberOfShares` rather than panicking (`frost/keygen.rs:375-378`).
- **Missing length check on `commitment.c` in `verify_commitment`.** Refuted as reachable harm. The Rust deliberately skips it (`frost/keygen.rs:83-85`) and the contract enforces `commitment.c.length == state.threshold` (`FROSTCoordinator.sol:378`). A zero-length `c` would make `verify_proof_of_knowledge` fail or error inside `frost-core` rather than panic — but that is upstream behaviour I cannot read (A6), so the claim is class `I`, not `E2`. Recorded as **Observation O4**.
- **Panics / casts / arithmetic in my files.** Swept and refuted: `consensus/group.rs:142-146` (`try_into.expect`) is bounded because `participants_set` already passed both `u16::try_from` gates at `206` and `211` before a `ParticipantSet` can exist; `group.rs:231-239` casts are bounded by `min <= max(count,1) <= 65535`; `group.rs:255-263,272-276,293-296` are constant-size slice writes; `ecdh.rs:115` `.to_affine.x` cannot hit the identity because the public key is non-identity (`70-75`) and the scalar is a `NonZeroScalar` on a prime-order curve; `ecdh.rs:130-131` two `expect`s are on `hash_to_field` with a single output and on a cryptographically-impossible zero; `marshal.rs:78-81` indexes a 65-byte constant buffer; `participants.rs:18` fails only if `HID(address) ≡ 0 mod n`; `epoch.rs:6-9` uses `saturating_add` on a `NonZeroU64::MIN`; `state/keygen.rs:109,196,351,385,449,879,1010` compare `map.len as u16` against `count` — truncation needs > 65535 map entries, which the contract's membership check bounds, and the failure mode is a round that never closes (liveness), not a panic; `state/keygen.rs:715-716` (`complaint.total += 1`, `unresponded += 1`, both `u16`) needs > 65535 complaints against one accused, while the contract permits one per (plaintiff, accused) pair (`FROSTParticipantMap.sol:183`) and `unresponded -= 1` is guarded by the `> 0` filter at `823`; `state/keygen.rs:474,518-520,1374-1378` all use `saturating_mul`/`saturating_add`. No `panic!`, `unreachable!`, `unimplemented!` or `todo!` in non-test code in my ten files.
- **Genesis restart producing an unauthorised group id.** Refuted — `restart_key_gen_excluding` returns `None` for `EpochId::Genesis` and halts (`state/keygen.rs:1195-1224`), which is the documented intent (`1182-1187`).
- **Rollover into a dishonest set via `handle_rollover_new_block`.** Refuted for the arithmetic: the abandon-and-restart path recomputes the participant set from config with `excluded: BTreeSet::new` (`state/keygen.rs:954-961`), so accumulated exclusions never carry past an epoch boundary and the two-thirds gate is re-applied on every start (`consensus/group.rs:212`). A validator only ever joins a group it computed from its **own** `config.participants`; consistency between operators is a deployment property, not a code defect (checklist 8) — recorded as **Observation O5**.
- **Secret material in `Debug` / `tracing` / metrics in my files.** `Secrets` (`frost/keygen.rs:27`), `SharingState` (`144`), `VerifiedShare` (`302`) and `KeyShare` (`433`) derive `Debug`; `EncryptionKey` has a redacting `Debug` (`ecdh.rs:50-54`) and zeroizes on drop (`56-62`), so the ECDH secret is safe, but the surrounding structs' redaction depends on `frost-core`'s `Debug` impls for `round1::SecretPackage`, `round2::SecretPackage` and `keys::KeyPackage`, whose source is not on disk (A6) — class `I`, never `E2`. The sites that actually print them (`service/effect.rs:249`, `core/effects.rs:59`) are R6's and R10's (VAL-H10 is assigned to them in `codebase-map.md:369-387`). `state/keygen.rs` logs only addresses, group ids, block numbers, counts and deadlines — I checked every `tracing::` call in it (`84-89`, `176-193`, `226-230`, `308-314`, `331-335`, `593-598`, `619-623`, `637-640`, `723-726`, `747-752`, `843-847`, `931-946`, `966-969`, `1011-1017`, `1036-1043`, `1059-1066`, `1102-1106`, `1128-1134`, `1159-1165`, `1428-1439`) and no secret is a field. Recorded as **Observation O6**.

### Observations (below 40%, not findings)

- **O1 — superseded.** Promoted to F-VAL-004.
- **O2 — `ReconcileGroupSecrets` vs same-block store writes** (VAL-H7). Effects emitted from Logs transitions in my files: `1149-1153`, `1320`, `1352-1355`. Left to R6.
- **O3 — identity coefficient commitments are accepted** (`marshal.rs:136-138`, `frost/keygen.rs:86-93`). Harmless under the PoK, but a participant contributing `a_0 = 0` is silently tolerated; a one-line `is_identity` check on `c[0]` would remove the question.
- **O4 — `verify_commitment` trusts the contract for `|c| == threshold`** (`frost/keygen.rs:83-85`). Behaviour on an empty `c` is `frost-core` internal (A6), class `I`. Becomes reachable only if Coordinator-shaped events can be injected from an address that is not the coordinator (VAL-H2, R6's finding).
- **O5 — `config.participants` is local per validator** (`consensus/group.rs:177-217`, `state/keygen.rs:954-961`, `1195-1210`). Two operators with different lists compute different group ids and silently fail to form a group; nothing onchain pins the expected set. Operational, checklist item 8.
- **O6 — secret-bearing structs in my files derive `Debug`** (`frost/keygen.rs:27,144,302,433`). Safe only if `frost-core` redacts; not verifiable offline. Owned by R6/R10 as VAL-H10.
- **O7 — restart with an empty exclusion delta is reachable only via injected events.** `handle_key_gen_timeouts`'s response branch (`state/keygen.rs:1083-1086`) excludes `complaints.keys` entries, and `handle_key_gen_complained` (`714`) inserts whatever `event.accused` says without checking `group.participants.contains(&event.accused)`. Under the contract that address is always a registered member, so the exclusion always shrinks the set and the group id always changes. If VAL-H2 (address-agnostic event dispatch, R6) holds, an injected `KeyGenComplained` naming a non-member makes `also_exclude` a no-op, `participants_set` returns the _same_ group id, and `start_key_gen` re-enters `CollectingCommitments` with an empty `commitments` map for a group the contract will never re-emit `KeyGenCommitted` for — the round then stalls to the commitment timeout, `exclude_all_others(∅)` excludes everyone, and the epoch is skipped or genesis halts. Conditional on R6's finding; recorded here so it is not lost.
- **O8 — `handle_epoch_staged`'s `WaitingForGenesis` recovery trusts the event's `proposedEpoch`** (`state/keygen.rs:613-635`). A staged epoch observed before genesis jumps the validator straight to `EpochSkipped { next_epoch }` using an attacker-influenced number if event-address binding is missing (VAL-H2). Under the contract the value is authenticated. Conditional on R6's finding.
- **O9 — no membership check on the addresses carried by DKG events.** `handle_key_gen_committed` inserts `event.participant` into `commitments` after `verify_commitment` alone (`state/keygen.rs:173-175`); `handle_key_gen_confirmed` inserts `event.participant` into `confirmations` with no check at all (`448`); `handle_key_gen_complained` inserts `event.accused` into `complaints` with no check (`714`). None of the three consults `group.participants`. Under A7 this is sound — the contract's `register` verifies a Merkle proof against the participant root that the group id itself commits to (`FROSTParticipantMap.sol:146-150`, `FROSTGroupId.sol:36-51`), and the validator only processes events whose `gid` equals the group it derived from its own config — so contract membership and local membership coincide exactly. It becomes reachable under VAL-H2 (R6): an injected `KeyGenConfirmed` from a non-member would push `confirmations.len` to `count` early, and `handle_key_gen_confirmed` would then call `finalize_key_gen(…, status.key_share)` with a `Collecting` status whose `key_share` is `None` (`1414-1423`), silently leaving the validator out of the new epoch. Listed as a defence-in-depth remediation in F-VAL-003 option 4.
- **O10 — doc-comment inaccuracy in `handle_key_gen_secret_shared`.** The function doc says share collection "still completes once every participant has submitted one (valid or not)" (`state/keygen.rs:267-274`), but the round-close gate counts `public_keys` (`351`), which is only populated when `verify_secret_share` succeeds (`303-306`). A share with a bad `y` therefore does **not** count and the round stalls to the timeout instead — which is what the inline comment at `294-297` correctly says. Comment-only; no behavioural defect. Flagged so a Critic reading the doc does not mistake it for a missing branch.

### Coverage notes

- Nothing in my ten files was left unread.
- Claims that depend on `frost-core` internals (`dkg::part1/2/3`, `verify_proof_of_knowledge`, `SecretShare::verify`, `Debug` redaction, behaviour on a zero-length commitment vector) are marked class `I` throughout, per A6 and the run-mode note: the crate source is not on disk.
- `E1` was unreachable this run: no toolchain. The three findings are `E2` plus `I` where they touch upstream behaviour.

### Hypotheses considered and REJECTED (with the citation that refuted them)

#### Assigned leads

- **VAL-H3 (phantom `NonceTree` reservation)** — CONFIRMED, not rejected. Filed as F-VAL-030. The analysis's ordering claim is correct: `state/mod.rs:464-481` runs `handle_nonce_topup` before `handle_group_reconciliation`, and `core/driver.rs:266-273` spawns both as concurrent tasks; `service/effect.rs:154-158` reaches `generator.next` (a synchronous `BTreeMap` lookup, `secrets/nonces.rs:57`) before `ReconcileGroupSecrets` finishes its two awaited `DELETE`s (`service/effect.rs:226-229`). One correction: `NonceState::observe` _does_ eventually prune a phantom via `self.chunks.split_off(&next_chunk)` (`state/preprocess.rs:191`), so the stall self-heals after ~1024 group signatures rather than being permanent.
- **VAL-H6 (permissionless `Coordinator.sign` burns sequences; dropped sessions never rejoin)** — PARTIALLY CONFIRMED. The session drop is real and filed as F-VAL-032 (`state/sign.rs:35` removes the session, `106-114` never re-inserts it). REJECTED sub-claim: "drains 1024-nonce chunks faster than the generator can replace them". `handle_nonce_topup` triggers at `available < 100` (`state/preprocess.rs:17,91`) and one reservation restores 1024 (`199-203`, `234-247`), while `Coordinator.sign` costs the attacker a full transaction per sequence (`sol:FROSTCoordinator.sol:530-542`); exhaustion needs sustained ~1000 tx/chunk. Griefing cost is linear in gas, so this is a cost-of-attack question, not a defect. Also REJECTED: "forces continuous preprocessing (CPU + gas)" as a separate impact — it is the same mechanism.
- **VAL-H8 (re-reveal to become `last_signer` and stall the ceremony)** — NOT filed by me; it lives in `state/sign.rs:282-284` and `522-562` which I read. Confirmed mechanically (`last_signer = Some(event.participant)` is overwritten on every accepted reveal, `state/sign.rs:284`, and the contract does not dedupe reveals, `sol:FROSTCoordinator.sol:554-558`). REJECTED as a finding at my severity bar because the impact is bounded at one extra `signing_timeout` (6 blocks) and the offender is then removed from `signers` by `state/sign.rs:643` (`signers.retain(|signer| revealed.contains_key(signer))` keeps them, but the _next_ timeout's `restart_signing_ceremony` path removes the previously responsible party at `595`). Left to the Critic as a Low observation; I did not out-rank R4/R6 on it.
- **VAL-H11 (backup restore resurrects consumed nonces)** — CONFIRMED with a sharper mechanism than the analysis gives. Filed as F-VAL-033. The analysis says "a restore after a reorg can resurrect burned nonces"; I re-derived that a restore alone is _safe_ (the snapshot table lives in the same file, so state and secrets rewind together and a deterministic replay of the same chain reproduces the same `(sequence, message)` binding, `state/preprocess.rs:180-194` + `sol:FROSTCoordinator.sol:536`). The unsafe case needs a reorg between the backup and the restore.
- **M4 (Merkle domain separation / `proof(index)` bounds)** — SPLIT. `proof(index)` out-of-bounds is UNREACHABLE: all three callers pass an in-range index — `frost/sign.rs:135` (`signers.range(..identifier).count`, and `129-132` already proved the identifier is present), `frost/preprocess.rs:136-139` (`enumerate` over the same vector the tree was built from), `consensus/group.rs:135-136` (`addresses.range(..address).count` guarded by `contains` at `129-131`). Leaf/internal confusion is REJECTED for the nonce tree (leaf = keccak of 160 bytes, `frost/preprocess.rs:165-171` ⇔ `sol:FROSTNonceCommitmentSet.sol:147-158`; internal = keccak of 64, `merkle.rs:89-92`) and the selection tree (leaf = keccak of 192, `frost/sign.rs:171-178` ⇔ `sol:FROSTSignatureShares.sol:118-128`). The remaining half — `B256::ZERO` padding versus the _unhashed_ participant leaf — is filed as F-VAL-037. Pad value and ordering both match OpenZeppelin's commutative `MerkleProof` (`merkle.rs:87-93` vs `sol:FROSTSignatureShares.sol:88`, `sol:FROSTNonceCommitmentSet.sol:132`, `sol:FROSTParticipantMap.sol:149`).
- **M5 (nonce deleted before the share is computed; snapshot rollback revives it)** — RE-DERIVED AND REFUTED as stated. The premise "the deleted nonce then lives only in snapshot state" is **wrong**: `Resume::Nonce` carries `Box<Nonces>` into `handle_nonces` (`service/effect.rs:196-200`, `state/sign.rs:359-404`), which consumes it into `frost::sign::signature_share` at `377` and returns only `Command::Action(Action::SignShare{..})`. The secret is never written to `State`; what the snapshot holds is `NonceIndex { root, offset }` only (`state/mod.rs:78-86`, `313`, `331`), which is public coordinate data. The single-use invariant therefore rests on `take_nonce`'s `DELETE ... RETURNING` (`secrets/store.rs:205-218`, pinned by the test at `421-446`) plus a second, independent onchain guard I verified: the contract derives the offset from the signature id's sequence (`sol:FROSTCoordinator.sol:556` → `sol:FROSTNonceCommitmentSet.sol:127-133`) and `sequence` is a strictly increasing per-group counter (`sol:FROSTCoordinator.sol:536`), so two different messages can never map to the same offset on one chain. The residual risks are exactly F-VAL-033 (cross-branch restore) and F-VAL-034 (stale resume). Reorg walk-through re-derived independently: reveal-then-reorg leaves the nonce intact and re-usable for the new message once (`nonces_reveal` is non-consuming, `store.rs:177-196`); use-then-reorg leaves `take_nonce` returning `None` (`store.rs:205-218`) so the validator simply does not participate.
- **M6 (`ON DELETE CASCADE` needs `PRAGMA foreign_keys = ON`)** — NOT REFUTABLE FROM THIS CHECKOUT, downgraded to a component of F-VAL-035. `crates/core/src/utils.rs:56-62` sets only `idle_timeout(None)` and `max_lifetime(None)` and never touches pragmas, and `crates/validator/src/config.rs:29` takes `SqliteConnectOptions` straight from the TOML URL. sqlx 0.9 (`Cargo.toml:19`) is documented to default `foreign_keys` on, but its source is not on disk (A6), so this is class `I`, not `E2`. What _is_ `E2` is that the store's own test module (`secrets/store.rs:262-447`) never calls `retain_nonces` and never asserts the cascade, so nothing in the repo pins the behaviour.
- **M7 (one `ChaCha12Rng` seed per chunk with `set_stream(offset + 1)`)** — REFUTED as a defect. `frost/preprocess.rs:112-121`: `let seed = ChaCha12Rng::from_rng(&mut *rng)?` is evaluated once per chunk (it is the block expression that _produces_ the closure, not part of it), each closure clones that freshly seeded generator and calls `rng.set_stream(offset.checked_add(1).expect("chunk too large"))`. Offsets `0..size` map to streams `1..=size`, all distinct, with stream 0 unused — there is no off-by-one and no repeated stream. The seed is a local, never persisted, never logged: it does not appear in any `tracing` call in the file, `Nonces` and `NonceChunk` both have hand-written redacting `Debug` (`frost/preprocess.rs:64-71`, `150-159`), and `Resume::Nonce` is only ever printed through that redacting impl (`core/effects.rs:59`, `core/driver.rs:261`). Recorded as an Informational note inside F-VAL-035 (a seed compromise is a whole-chunk compromise), not as a finding.
- **Validator checklist 3 (effect durability across restarts)** — the `NonceTree` half is F-VAL-030; the `RevealNonceCommitments` half is benign (a lost reveal costs one ceremony, `state/sign.rs:138-164`); the `UseNonce` half is fail-closed (nonce burned, no share, `service/effect.rs:189-201`).
- **Validator checklist 4 (nonce single-use under all resume orderings)** — see M5 above and F-VAL-034.
- **Validator checklist 5 (sequence griefing)** — see VAL-H6 above and F-VAL-032.
- **Validator checklist 10 (backup/restore)** — F-VAL-033.

#### My own hypotheses, rejected

- **EIP-712 / message-hash mismatch with Solidity (PROMPT priority 3)** — REJECTED, everything matches byte for byte. Domain: `Eip712Domain::new(None, None, Some(chain), Some(consensus), None)` (`consensus/hashing.rs:95-103`) yields the type string `EIP712Domain(uint256 chainId,address verifyingContract)`, whose hash is the precomputed `sol:ConsensusMessages.sol:16-18` constant, and the contract feeds it `block.chainid, address(this)` (`sol:Consensus.sol:148-149`). `TransactionProposal(uint64 epoch,address oracle,bytes oracleData,bytes32 safeTxHash)` (`hashing.rs:38-43`) ⇔ `sol:ConsensusMessages.sol:27-30`, and the hand-rolled 160-byte encoding at `hashing.rs:124-136` reproduces `sol:ConsensusMessages.sol:102-113` slot for slot (`0x1901` at offset 0, separator at 2, struct hash at 34, 66-byte digest). `EpochRollover(uint64 activeEpoch,uint64 proposedEpoch,uint64 rolloverBlock,uint256 groupKeyX,uint256 groupKeyY)` (`hashing.rs:47-53`) ⇔ `sol:ConsensusMessages.sol:21-24`. `SafeTx(...)` (`hashing.rs:23-34`) ⇔ `sol:SafeTransaction.sol:64-66`, and `safe_tx_hash`'s per-Safe domain (`hashing.rs:85`) ⇔ `sol:SafeTransaction.sol:126-131`. `transaction_packet_hash` reconstructs exactly what `proposeTransaction` emits: `epochs.active`, `oracle`, `keccak256(oracleData)`, `transaction.hash` (`sol:Consensus.sol:257-265` vs `state/transactions.rs:42-47`), and `handle_transaction_attested` reconstructs `attestTransaction`'s message from the event's already-hashed fields (`state/transactions.rs:86-91` vs `sol:Consensus.sol:281-282`). Three tests pin the result including a `SolStruct` cross-check (`hashing.rs:198-248`).
- **Signer-selection leaf mismatch** — REJECTED. `signer_leaf` writes `participant` left-padded into slot 0 then `r.x, r.y, l, group_r.x, group_r.y` (`frost/sign.rs:171-178`); `sol:FROSTSignatureShares.sol:118-128` writes `participant`, `share.r` (two words), `share.l`, `r` (two words) — same 192-byte preimage, pinned by the vector at `frost/sign.rs:186-203`.
- **Nonce-commitment leaf mismatch** — REJECTED. `nonces_leaf` (`frost/preprocess.rs:164-172`) ⇔ `sol:FROSTNonceCommitmentSet.sol:147-158`; both are `keccak256(offset ‖ d.x ‖ d.y ‖ e.x ‖ e.y)` over 160 bytes. Proof length is exactly 10 because the chunk is exactly 1024 (`frost/preprocess.rs:24`, `merkle.rs:13-29`), satisfying `require(proof.length == _CHUNKSZ)` (`sol:FROSTNonceCommitmentSet.sol:131`).
- **`startOffset` desynchronisation (validator reveals an offset below the contract's `startOffset`)** — REJECTED. `sol:FROSTNonceCommitmentSet.sol:129` rejects `offset < startOffset`, and `startOffset` is the group sequence at the moment the `preprocess` transaction executes (`sol:FROSTNonceCommitmentSet.sol:97-104`). Every later `Sign` has a sequence `>=` that value (`sol:FROSTCoordinator.sol:536`), so `observe` (`state/preprocess.rs:180-194`) can only ever hand out an offset `>= startOffset` within that chunk. A chain rewind that lowers the sequence also rewinds the commitment.
- **Rust/contract chunk-index divergence (`expected_chunk` vs `FROSTNonceCommitmentSet.commit`)** — REJECTED. `expected_chunk` computes `max(last_tracked + 1, next_sequence >> 10)` (`state/preprocess.rs:226-232`); the contract computes `max(commitments.next, sequence >> 10)` (`sol:FROSTNonceCommitmentSet.sol:97-104`). They agree in the steady state and both fall back to `sequence >> 10` once the validator's tracked chunks have been pruned. And divergence would be harmless anyway: `handle_preprocess` links whatever chunk index the _event_ reports (`state/preprocess.rs:79`).
- **Two `Effect::UseNonce` in flight for the same `(root, offset)`** — REJECTED. `handle_sign_revealed_nonces` emits it only on the `revealed.len >= signers.len` edge and immediately leaves `CollectNonceCommitments` (`state/sign.rs:304-344`); every later `SignRevealedNonces` for that message lands in the `Some(other)` arm (`346-349`). A replayed effect re-runs `take_nonce`, which returns `None` (`secrets/store.rs:205-218`, test `421-431`).
- **Two `Epoch`s sharing one group id, so `handle_sign`'s `.find` picks the wrong `NonceState`** — REJECTED. `group_id` mixes the group context, which embeds the epoch number (`consensus/group.rs:252-264` and the `group_context` note in `analysis-validator.md:205`), so ids are unique per epoch.
- **`WaitingForOracle` holding a nonce across the 12-block oracle timeout gets its chunk pruned out from under it** — REJECTED. `observe`'s `split_off` prunes `NonceState.chunks` (`state/preprocess.rs:191`) but the session already carries the resolved `NonceIndex` (`state/mod.rs:313`), and the store retains rows per group, not per chunk (`secrets/store.rs:227-229`).
- **Selection-root ambiguity on a `CollectSigningShares` timeout** — REJECTED. `max_by_key` over the filtered selections (`state/sign.rs:677-683`) is unique because the filter is `>= group_threshold` and the threshold is `count/2 + 1` (`consensus/group.rs:220-222`), so at most one selection can hold a majority.
- **`signature_share` panicking or building a bad proof** — REJECTED. `signers.get(key_package.identifier)` fails closed with `UnknownIdentifier` (`frost/sign.rs:129-132`) before `signers.range(..identifier).count` is used as the proof index (`135`), and both `expect`s in `binding_factor_to_scalar` (`154-159`) are over a fixed 32-byte canonical serialisation.
- **`i64::try_from(offset)` overflow in the store** — REJECTED. Offsets come from `sequence % 1024` (`frost/preprocess.rs:28-33`) so they are `< 1024`; the conversion is handled as an error anyway (`secrets/store.rs:47-55`, `159`, `187`, `211`).
- **SQL injection through `retain_groups`' `format!("DELETE FROM {table}")`** — REJECTED. `table: &'static str` with exactly two call sites passing literals (`secrets/store.rs:136`, `228`); group ids go through `push_bind` (`244-246`).
- **Secret leakage through `tracing` on the nonce path** — REJECTED. `Nonces` and `NonceChunk` have hand-written redacting `Debug` (`frost/preprocess.rs:64-71`, `150-159`); `Effect::UseNonce`/`NonceTree`/`RevealNonceCommitments` carry only `B256`s and offsets (`service/effect.rs:39-54`); the `warn!(?effect, ...)` at `service/effect.rs:249` and the `trace!(?resume, ...)` at `core/effects.rs:59` therefore print nothing secret for these variants. (`Effect::StartNonceGeneration`/`ReconcileGroupSecrets` carry `Arc<KeyShare>` — that is VAL-H10, owned by R6/R10, not re-filed here.) No metric label carries secret or per-ceremony data (`metrics.rs` per `analysis-validator.md:88`).
- **`RevealedNonces` leaking a secret through `Debug`/`Serialize`** — REJECTED. It wraps only `round1::SigningCommitments`, which are the public `(D, E)` points published onchain (`frost/sign.rs:25-28`, `37-43`).
- **`handle_transaction_proposed` trusting `event.safeTxHash`** — REJECTED. It never reads that field; it recomputes the message from the `transaction` preimage (`state/transactions.rs:42-47`), and the contract derives the same value from the same preimage (`sol:Consensus.sol:257-261`).
- **Duplicate-proposal session reset griefing** — REJECTED, already guarded: `btree_map::Entry::Vacant` dedupes by message hash (`state/transactions.rs:52-73`).
- **`handle_sign_shared` accepting shares from non-signers** — REJECTED as intended and safe; the comment at `state/sign.rs:425-429` is correct, since the onchain Merkle inclusion proof (`sol:FROSTSignatureShares.sol:86-88`) makes it impossible to register against a root you are not in.
- **`MerkleTree::build` producing an empty or single-leaf tree in production** — REJECTED. Selection trees have `>= group_threshold >= 2` leaves (`state/sign.rs:304`, `538`), nonce trees have exactly 1024 (`frost/preprocess.rs:24`, `92`), participant trees have `count >= min_participants >= 2` (`consensus/group.rs:227-240`).

### Observations (plausible, below the 40% bar, not filed as findings)

1. **`handle_signing_timeouts`' `WaitingForOracle` and `CollectSigningShares` arms bind fields they never use** (`state/sign.rs:617-625`, `662-670`: `key_share`, `oracle`, `group_id`, `nonce`, `packet`, `signers`, `revealed`). With no `[lints]` table in `Cargo.toml` and no `#[allow]` in the crate, these should be `unused_variables` warnings; I could not compile to check. If they are genuinely unused the code is correct, but the exhaustive patterns suggest an intent to force review when fields change — worth confirming under `cargo clippy`.
2. **`Action::Preprocess` carries no expiry** (`service/action.rs:250-254`). A preprocess transaction that keeps reverting (for example the group is not yet `FINALIZED`, `sol:FROSTCoordinator.sol:515`) is retried by the durable queue forever while the state machine's chunk reservation stays `None`. Related to F-VAL-030 but a different mechanism; I could not read `core/tx/mod.rs`'s retry policy (R3's scope).
3. **`register_nonces_chunk` is not idempotent and will hard-fail on a root collision** (`secrets/store.rs:150-155`: a bare `INSERT` into `nonces_chunks`, primary key `root`). A collision needs two identical 1024-nonce chunks, so this is unreachable in practice, but the failure mode is an effect error rather than a no-op.
4. **`NonceGenerator` streams are unbounded in count** (`secrets/nonces.rs:19`, `36-46`): one detached OS thread plus one eagerly precomputed 1024-nonce chunk resident in memory per tracked group. Bounded in practice by `handle_group_reconciliation`'s epoch reaping (`state/preprocess.rs:114-119`), so I did not file it.
5. **`handle_nonce_topup` only tops up `state.active_epoch`** (`state/preprocess.rs:86-89`). A validator participating in an older epoch's signing sessions (retained by `handle_group_reconciliation`, `state/preprocess.rs:114-119`) never replenishes that epoch's nonces. Probably intended, since an old epoch signs at most a handful of trailing ceremonies.
6. **A stale `Resume::NonceCommitments` is guarded by signature id but a stale `Resume::Nonce` is not** — `handle_nonce_commitments` checks `*sid == signature_id` (`state/sign.rs:146-153`) while `handle_nonces` checks only the message (`359-375`). See F-VAL-034; the asymmetry looks accidental.
7. **The x-of-`available` accounting treats a `None` reservation and a linked chunk identically** (`state/preprocess.rs:234-247`). Even without the F-VAL-030 crash window, this means the top-up threshold is measured against capacity that is not yet usable, so the validator runs with a smaller real buffer than the 100-nonce threshold implies.

### 3. Hypotheses considered — confirmed, refuted, or filed

#### Filed as findings

| Lead | Outcome | Finding |
| --- | --- | --- |
| VAL-H2 / CORE-H4 (event address binding) | **Confirmed as a mechanism**, impact conditional on the oracle allow-list | F-VAL-060 |
| VAL-H3, restated from the two files I own (effect failure policy + per-block command order) | **Confirmed** | F-VAL-061 |
| VAL-H10 (secret hygiene), narrowed to the checkable half | **Confirmed for the crate's own code**; the upstream half is class `I` and unresolvable offline | F-VAL-062 |
| Validator checklist 8 (config trust) | **Confirmed** | F-VAL-063 |
| CORE-H3 applied to `main.rs`, composed with the Dockerfile and `/health` | **Confirmed** | F-VAL-064 |
| Action replay / expiry / dedup (brief's "a replayed action must not become a harmful duplicate") | **Confirmed** for three of twelve actions | F-VAL-065 |
| VAL-H7 (reconciliation race) | **Mechanism confirmed, trigger unproven**; widened with the pre-genesis unqualified-wipe path | F-VAL-066 |

#### Refuted, with the citation that refuted each

| ID | Hypothesis | Refuted by |
| --- | --- | --- |
| H-R6-1 | The `sol!` bindings might not match the deployed ABI, so an event could be silently undecodable or a call could carry a wrong selector. | Computed `keccak256` of the canonical signature of all 18 events and all 18 functions in `bindings.rs` (structs expanded to tuples; `FROSTGroupId.T`/`FROSTSignatureId.T`/`SafeId.T` → `bytes32`; `Operation` → `uint8`) with a pure-Python Keccak-256 self-tested against the empty-string and `"abc"` vectors. All match `contracts/src/FROSTCoordinator.sol:168-264,343-620`, `contracts/src/Consensus.sol:186-290`, `contracts/src/interfaces/IConsensus.sol:24-104`, `contracts/src/interfaces/IOracle.sol:20`. Struct field types and order verified against `libraries/Secp256k1.sol:18-21`, `libraries/FROST.sol:36-51`, `libraries/SafeTransaction.sol:30-43`, `FROSTCoordinator.sol:97-154`. |
| H-R6-2 | Two events across the three watched contracts might share a `topic0`, so `watcher_events!`'s first-match-wins decode (`core/index/events.rs:577-590`) could misdecode one as the other. | Same computation: no `topic0` collisions among the 18 events and no 4-byte collisions among the 18 selectors. Topic list recorded in the finding F-VAL-060's _Considered and rejected_. |
| H-R6-3 | `Consensus.getCoordinator` is read once at `main.rs:49-52` and never re-read, so a coordinator change mid-run would silently orphan the validator. | `contracts/src/Consensus.sol:60` declares `FROSTCoordinator private immutable _COORDINATOR;`, set only in the constructor at `:119-120`, with no setter anywhere in the file. The address cannot change. **This is the answer to the specific question in my launch brief.** |
| H-R6-4 | The Rust dispatch might mishandle `EpochProposed` / `ValidatorStakerSet`, which are decoded but unrouted (`state/mod.rs:461-462`). | The catch-all `_ => (state, Vec::new)` is total and the comment states the intent. Ignoring `EpochProposed` is safe because `handle_rollover_new_block` derives the same rollover block from the same clock; ignoring `ValidatorStakerSet` only means the startup reconciliation is not event-driven (noted in F-VAL-065 remediation). |
| H-R6-5 | `IConsensus` declares `EpochRolledOver(uint64)` (`contracts/src/interfaces/IConsensus.sol:66`) but `bindings.rs` does not bind it, so the local `active_epoch` could diverge from the contract's. | Not a divergence: `Consensus._epochsWithRollover` (`:378-386`) applies rollover on the same `rolloverBlock <= block.number` test the validator's `handle_rollover_new_block` (`state/keygen.rs:917-938`) uses, so the two agree whenever `blocks_per_epoch` agrees. Recorded instead as remediation option 2 of F-VAL-063, since watching the event is the cheapest detector for a `blocks_per_epoch` mismatch. |
| H-R6-6 | A panic reachable from untrusted input in my files would be a crash loop. | Mechanical sweep of all eight `.rs` files for `unwrap`, `expect(`, `panic!`, `unreachable!`, `todo!`, `unimplemented!`, `as u*`, `as i*` and indexing, excluding `#[cfg(test)]`. Only two hits: `config.rs:90,94,98,102` (`NonZeroU64::new(<non-zero literal>).unwrap` inside `const fn`, const-evaluated) and `action.rs:154` (`25_000 * share.f.len as u64`, a widening cast on 64-bit; overflow would need | f | > 7.4e14 while the value comes from the validator's own bounded group). **No panic reachable from chain input exists in my scope**, and the `Transition` dispatch in `state/mod.rs:414-499` is total (a `_` arm for events, an exhaustive match for resumes), so the "transitions never fail" contract holds for the wiring layer. |
| H-R6-7 | Duplicate `participants` entries in the config could inflate `count` and break group formation. | `participants_set` collects into a `BTreeSet<Address>` before `count` is derived (`consensus/group.rs:180-184`, `:193-200`, `:206-211`), so duplicates dedupe harmlessly. |
| H-R6-8 | An empty or single-entry `participants` list would start a broken validator. | `min_participants` floors at 2 (`consensus/group.rs:239`), `participants_set` returns `None`, and `ValidatorService::new` fails with `Error::InvalidValidators` (`service/mod.rs:51-57`, `:127-128`). Fails loudly. Only the empty `oracles` default fails silently, which is why F-VAL-063 covers that one. |
| H-R6-9 | A zero `consensus` address parses (a `config.rs` test uses it), so the validator might start against nothing. | Startup fails at `Consensus::getCoordinator` (`main.rs:49-52`); `main` returns `Err` and exits non-zero. |
| H-R6-10 | The metrics could leak a secret or blow up label cardinality. | Every label is a `&'static str` from a closed enum (`metrics.rs:26-32`, `:75-84`, `:102-107`); two metrics, 3 + 12 series, all pre-materialised at zero (`:123-132`). No secret, no unbounded cardinality. The only weakness is that `Success` covers "an expected no-op" (`:91-92`), folded into F-VAL-061. |
| H-R6-11 | `Action::KeyGenComplaintResponse.secret_share` is a plaintext scalar; something might log it. | `Action` derives `Debug` but is never printed: `driver.rs:270` encodes without logging, and no `tracing` call in the validator or core takes an `Action`. The value is a protocol-mandated public reveal in any case. |
| H-R6-12 | The effect handler might hold the `Mutex<NonceGenerator>` across an `await`, serialising or deadlocking effects. | All three lock sites drop the guard before the next `.await`: `effect.rs:148-151` (temporary), `:155-159` (guard scoped to a block; `next` returns an owned `impl Future + 'static`), `:231-235` (only sync `retain`/`start` under the lock). |
| H-R6-13 | Checklist 13 / CORE-H1's validator half: a restart onto a different branch resumes a snapshot bound to a block number rather than a hash, which could revive a consumed nonce. | It cannot revive a nonce. The `SecretStore` is deliberately never rolled back and `take_nonce` is a `DELETE … RETURNING` (`secrets/store.rs:205-218`), so a nonce consumed on the orphaned branch stays consumed and a replay resumes `Resume::Noop`. The residual harm is a DKG state inconsistent with the chain, which fails safe: `verify_commitment` yields `IncorrectCommitment` → `rollover_failure` → `EpochSkipped` for a numbered epoch, `Halted` for genesis (`state/keygen.rs:1426-1440`). So the validator half of CORE-H1 is a fail-safe liveness event, not a nonce-reuse. Filed the adjacent, genuinely missing control — no chain-id or contract binding on the database (`core/state/storage.rs:50-55`) — as part of F-VAL-063. |
| H-R6-14 | Checklist 11: one of the twelve fixed gas constants might be too low for realistic group sizes, causing silent out-of-gas. | **Not established, and not claimed.** `keyGenCommit` does not store the commitment vector (`FROSTCoordinator.sol:365-383` adds `c[0]` to the group key and emits; no per-coefficient SSTORE), so the flat 250 000 is not obviously wrong at the sizes in `consensus/group.rs`'s tests. Evaluating the constants needs a Foundry gas report (A9 FALSE), so I recorded only the structural facts I can cite: eleven of twelve limits are flat while one scales, and `mark_executed` (`core/tx/storage.rs:222-235`) infers execution from the account nonce without reading a receipt, so an out-of-gas revert is recorded as executed and never retried. Both are in F-VAL-065; the constants themselves are an observation below. |
| H-R6-15 | `deny_unknown_fields` on `Config` might be silently disabled by the `#[serde(flatten)] driver` field, weakening typo protection. | **Unresolved, and deliberately not claimed.** serde documents the combination as unsupported; I could not determine offline whether serde 1.x rejects it at derive time (in which case it is honoured, since CI compiles) or ignores it. No test covers it — the four `config.rs` tests only assert successful parses. Recorded as an open question in F-VAL-063 and as remediation ("add a test asserting an unknown top-level key is rejected"), which settles it in one line. |
| H-R6-16 | The reference oracle contracts might already be able to emit Coordinator-shaped events, making F-VAL-060 unconditional. | Refuted: `SentinelOracle.sol` declares only `OracleResult` plus dispute/bond/governance events, `SimpleOracle.sol` and `AlwaysApproveOracle.sol` only `OracleResult`. None collides with a Coordinator or Consensus selector (H-R6-2). F-VAL-060 therefore states its precondition explicitly rather than claiming present exploitability. |
| H-R6-17 | The builder stage's `COPY crates/ crates/` might bake a real `validator.toml` into the published image. | The runtime stage is a fresh `debian:trixie-slim` that copies only `target/release/validator` (`Dockerfile:24-32`), so nothing from the build context reaches the published image. Downgraded to a build-context hygiene point (no `.dockerignore` exists) inside F-VAL-064 rather than a secret-in-image finding. |
| H-R6-18 | `Effect::NonceTree` being non-idempotent under replay (a replay draws a _different_ chunk) might strand or double-spend nonces. | It does not corrupt state: `handle_preprocess` links whichever chunk the chain reports (`state/preprocess.rs:73-80`), and `handle_nonce_tree` calls `ensure_chunk_reservation` precisely for the reorg case (`:37-41`). The cost is a duplicate `Preprocess` with no expiry, wasted gas and a wasted 1024-nonce chunk — filed as point 2 of F-VAL-065 rather than a correctness finding. |
| H-R6-19 | `ReconcileGroupSecrets` racing the _same block's_ `NonceTree` (both emitted from one `NewBlock` command vector) could delete freshly registered nonces. | Cannot happen: both are computed from the same state, so the topped-up epoch's group is in the retention set by construction (`state/mod.rs:468-469`, `state/preprocess.rs:121-125`). Only groups introduced by a _log_ transition are exposed — which is what F-VAL-066 covers. |

### 4. Observations (plausible, below the finding bar, not silently dropped)

1. **Gas constants have no margin signal.** Eleven of twelve limits in `service/action.rs` are flat, including `keyGenAndCommit` (250 000) whose calldata carries `threshold` curve points plus a PoAP proof, and `signShareWithCallback` (400 000) which must cover onchain share verification _and_ the `attestTransaction`/`stageEpoch` callback. Only `KeyGenSecretShare` scales. I could not size these without Foundry (A9 FALSE). Recommend the QA phase run `forge test --gas-report` for the largest intended group and compare, since the failure mode (`mark_executed` on a nonce advance, no receipt read) is silent.
2. **`Effect::KeyGenSetup` runs `frost::keygen::setup` — including `dkg::part1` — inline in the effect task** (`service/effect.rs:131-134`), on a tokio worker thread rather than `spawn_blocking`. Group sizes are small so this is almost certainly fine, but it is the one CPU-bound operation on the async runtime in my scope; nonce chunk generation correctly uses a dedicated OS thread.
3. **`InternalError` flattens the error chain.** `From<E: Error>` stores only `value.to_string` (`service/effect.rs:268-274`), dropping `source`, so the `warn!` that reports a failed effect shows the outermost message only — e.g. a sqlx error without the underlying SQLite code. Minor, but it is the sole diagnostic for every effect failure (F-VAL-061).
4. **No metric or log records ceremony progress or nonce inventory.** `metrics.rs` exposes exactly two counters. There is no gauge for reserved-vs-linked nonce chunks, DKG phase, or epoch, so every failure mode in F-VAL-061 and F-VAL-066 is invisible to monitoring even after it has occurred.
5. **`main.rs:56` builds `watched` as a `Vec` with no deduplication and no check that an oracle address differs from `consensus`/`coordinator`.** Duplicates are harmless in an `eth_getLogs` filter; the missing distinctness check is folded into F-VAL-060's remediation option 3.
6. **The genesis DKG runs with `deadline: None` throughout**, so every DKG action encoded during genesis (`KeyGenAndCommit`, `KeyGenSecretShare`, `KeyGenComplain`, `KeyGenConfirm`, `KeyGenComplaintResponse`) is queued with `expires_at: None` and can never be dropped by the queue however stale it becomes. This is the same root as VAL-H4 (R4's lead) seen from the action-encoder side; not filed separately.
7. **`crates/sentinel/src/main.rs` ends identically to the validator's** (`driver.run.await; Ok()`), so F-VAL-064's exit-code claim is cross-crate. R7 owns that file.
8. **`Resume::Setup`/`Resume::Nonce` are printed at `trace` by `safenet-core`** (`effects.rs:59`, `:78`, `driver.rs:261`) in addition to the validator's own `warn` site. If the `Debug` question in F-VAL-062 resolves badly, those two sites are also affected and are R2's files.

### 5. Findings written

| ID | Title | Reviewer severity | Self-estimate |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| F-VAL-060 | Coordinator and Consensus events dispatched without checking the emitting contract address | High | 80% mechanism, ~25% precondition reachable today |
| F-VAL-061 | Failed effects become `Resume::Noop` with no retry, stranding anticipatory state | High | 75% |
| F-VAL-062 | Secret-bearing effects/resumes derive `Debug` and are printed at `warn` | Low (Critical if upstream does not redact) | 85% inconsistency, ~25% secrets actually print |
| F-VAL-063 | Consensus-critical config unvalidated, unanchored, with unsafe defaults | Medium | 80% |
| F-VAL-064 | Fatal exits return code 0, `/health` unreachable by default, container runs as root | Medium | 90% |
| F-VAL-065 | Two actions never expire, none is deduplicated; a duplicate `Sign` burns a group nonce sequence | Low | 70% |
| F-VAL-066 | `ReconcileGroupSecrets` deletes from a pre-log retention set concurrently with the block's store writes | Medium | 45% (mechanism ~95%, trigger unproven) |

### 6. Gaps and caveats

- Nothing was executed. Every claim is `E2` (cited code plus a concrete input/state/event sequence) or, where labelled, `I`.
- `frost-core` / `frost-secp256k1` 3.0.0 sources are **not on disk**: `~/.cargo/registry` does not exist and a filesystem search for `frost-core*` found nothing. Every statement about upstream `Debug`, zeroisation or `round2::sign` behaviour is therefore class `I` under A6. This is the only unresolved question in F-VAL-062.
- The gas constants (observation 1) and the serde `flatten`/`deny_unknown_fields` interaction (H-R6-15) are the two questions in my scope that a toolchain would settle in minutes and that I could not settle here. Both are flagged for QA with the exact command or test that resolves them.
- I did not review `state/keygen.rs`, `state/sign.rs`, `state/preprocess.rs`, `secrets/*` or `frost/*` for their own defects — those are R4's and R5's scope. I read the parts cited above only as evidence for claims about my own files, and F-VAL-061 and F-VAL-066 explicitly flag their overlap with VAL-H3 and VAL-H7 for the Manager to merge.

### 4. Hypotheses considered and rejected

#### From the map (Section 6.3) and the prior analysis

| Lead | Outcome | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SEN-H1 | **Confirmed** → F-SEN-002. Mechanism re-derived independently before reading the analysis' version; the analysis' cited lines all exist. | `service.rs:307-319`, `372-374`, `626-633` |
| SEN-H2 | **Confirmed** → F-SEN-001. | `service.rs:307-319`, `410-417`; `core/index/blocks.rs:255-278`; `core/state/mod.rs:246-258` |
| SEN-H3 | **Confirmed, narrowed** → F-SEN-003. The analysis' variant (a) ("`Claim` succeeds if the request is already resolved but reverts if it is `FROZEN`") is the only genuinely lossy branch; when the dispute has already resolved the post-warp `Claim` succeeds. Variant (b) is really F-SEN-002's mechanism. | `core/state/mod.rs:173-181`; `service.rs:347-362`, `450-465`, `626-671`; `contracts/src/libraries/SentinelOracleRequests.sol:239-245` |
| SEN-H4 | **Confirmed as code facts, economics unproven** → F-SEN-004 at Medium (map guessed High). | `core/effects.rs:54-62`; `core/tx/mod.rs:204-216`; `core/tx/storage.rs:150-155` |
| SEN-H5 | **Confirmed** → F-SEN-007, extended with the `consensus`/`fee_token` cross-validation half of SEN-H12. | `service.rs:226-242`, `286-289`; `main.rs:64-83`; `contracts/src/SentinelOracle.sol:231-236` |
| SEN-H6 | **Confirmed** → F-SEN-005. Verified by `grep -rn "WaitingForDisputeResolution" crates/sentinel/src`: no construction site carries a block number, and `bindings.rs:47-57` has no `timeoutArbitration`. | `service.rs:466`, `646-654`; `action.rs:9-25` |
| SEN-H7 | **Confirmed** → F-SEN-006. `grep -n "DISTINCT\|UNIQUE\|idempot\|dedup" crates/core/src/tx/*.rs` returns nothing. | `core/driver.rs:266-284`; `core/tx/storage.rs:89-104` |
| SEN-H8 | **Partly rejected, partly confirmed** → F-SEN-008 at Low. The "unlimited approval / accumulating allowance" half is **refuted**: `approve` assigns, the spender is always `self.oracle`, and the outstanding allowance is at most one `bondTarget`, spendable only by `commit` with `msg.sender == sentinel`. The gas-limit and non-zero-to-non-zero halves stand as conditional on the deployed token. | `service.rs:678-688`; `contracts/src/SentinelOracle.sol:234-236` |
| SEN-H9 | **Not filed as a finding — observation 5.1.** Under A3 the engine is a trusted co-deployed component, so "the engine is compromised" is out of the threat model; the residual point (no local loss budget for engine _mistakes_) is a design gap, not a defect, and is not supported by a code-level guard that is missing. | `service.rs:173-180`; A3 |
| SEN-H10 | **Confirmed** → F-SEN-011. The decisive evidence the analysis did not state is that `WaitingForEngineCheck` does not persist the `SafeTransaction` the effect needs, so the check cannot be re-issued from state alone. | `state.rs:25-32` vs `effect.rs:17-26` |
| SEN-H11 | **Confirmed** → F-SEN-012. `grep -rn "retry\|backoff" crates/sentinel/src` returns nothing. | `engine.rs:166-190`; `service.rs:176-179` |
| SEN-H12 | **Split.** Cross-validation half → F-SEN-007; `voting_window` / engine-timeout half → F-SEN-009. `grep -rn "voting_window" crates/sentinel/src` confirms there is no validation site. | `config.rs:49-59`; `main.rs:45-62` |
| SEN-H13 | **Confirmed** → F-SEN-014 (Informational). | `service.rs:635-641`; `contracts/src/libraries/SentinelOracleRequests.sol:174` |
| SEN-H14 | **Not filed by me — observation 5.2, owned by R10** (`codebase-map.md` Section 9 assigns SEN-H14 to R10). Recorded with citations so it is not dropped. | `engine.rs:113`, `131-134` |
| SEN-H15 | **Not filed by me — observation 5.3, owned by R10** (Section 9 assigns SEN-H15 to R10). | `config.rs:63-64` vs `core/tx/signer.rs:84-94` |
| **M8** (Manager lead: `hashing.rs:16-40`, `core/tx/signer.rs:58-68`) | **Refuted / closed.** `reason` is produced once in `handle_engine_check_result` (`service.rs:173-180`), hashed into the commitment in `commit_vote` (`service.rs:213`), stored verbatim in `CollectingCommitments.reason` (`service.rs:218`), carried through `WaitingForRequest` unchanged (`service.rs:261-263`), and finally **moved** — not re-derived, re-formatted or re-queried — into the `Reveal` action with `std::mem::take(reason)` (`service.rs:424`, `432`). `grep -n "reason" crates/sentinel/src/service.rs` shows every non-test occurrence; there is no path that re-contacts the engine or reconstructs the string. The only formatting site is `RuleId::Display` (`engine.rs:45-49`), which is ASCII, locale-independent, uses no floating point and performs no truncation, and it runs exactly once, before the hash. The state round-trips through `serde_json` per snapshot (`core/state/mod.rs:236`), which is byte-exact for a valid UTF-8 `String`. `approve` is carried the same way. **M8 is closed.** |
| Sentinel checklist item 1 (phase-lag robustness) | Answered: **no**, `Committed`/`Revealed`/`DisputeResolved` _can_ be discarded for a bonded request → F-SEN-001, F-SEN-002, F-SEN-003. |
| Checklist item 2 (early-finalise soundness) | Answered: **not sound** under an undercount; and `finalize` does drop entries with `self_committed == true` and no `Claim` → F-SEN-002. |
| Checklist item 3 (non-reveal exposure) | Enumerated: F-SEN-001 (replayed `Committed` discarded), F-SEN-003 (warp), F-SEN-004 (reveal expires in a backlog). The analysis' fourth candidate — "crash between the snapshot and the enqueue" — is **refuted** in the normal case (see rejected item "narrow crash window" below). |
| Checklist item 4 (claim completeness) | Enumerated: `Claim` is emitted at `service.rs:519-527`, `568-574`, `664-671`. It is **not** emitted at `service.rs:631-633` (F-SEN-002), at `service.rs:415-417` (F-SEN-001) or after the `FROZEN` revert-then-drop of F-SEN-003, and never for a request parked in `WaitingForDisputeResolution` forever (F-SEN-005). |
| Checklist item 5 (flood behaviour) | Answered → F-SEN-004. The sentinel never declines to commit. |
| Checklist item 6 (pre-flight checks) | Answered → F-SEN-007, F-SEN-008. |
| Checklist item 7 (replay idempotency) | Answered → F-SEN-006; the `Finalize`-from-everyone question → F-SEN-014. |
| Checklist item 8 (engine trust and policy) | Retry → F-SEN-012. Loss budget → observation 5.1. JSON body shape → observation 5.6. `block = event.block` semantics → observation 5.7. |
| Checklist item 9 (timeouts) | Answered → F-SEN-009 (engine timeout), F-SEN-005 (dispute deadline + `timeoutArbitration`). |
| Checklist item 10 (config validation at startup) | Answered → F-SEN-007, F-SEN-010. |
| Checklist item 11 (hashing parity) | **Refuted as a defect** — see the two parity checks below. |
| Checklist item 12 (decode robustness) | → F-SEN-013, with the pivotal alloy claim explicitly class `I`. |
| Checklist item 13 (secrets hygiene) | Config zeroisation → observation 5.3 (R10). Proxy/redirect → observation 5.2 (R10). RPC URL in transport errors is core's, not the sentinel's. |

#### Rejected by my own reading (with the citation that refuted each)

- **Commit-hash mismatch with Solidity.** Refuted. Rust hashes `[u8::from(approve)] ‖ salt(32) ‖ sentinel(20) ‖ request_id(32) ‖ reason` (`hashing.rs:31-37`); Solidity is `keccak256(abi.encodePacked(approve, salt, sentinel, requestId, reason))` (`contracts/src/libraries/SentinelOracleCommitments.sol:47-56`), where `bool` packs to 1 byte, `bytes32` to 32, `address` to 20 and `string` to its raw bytes. Identical. Parity vectors exist on both sides (`hashing.rs:168-192`).
- **Request-id mismatch with Solidity.** Refuted. `TransactionProposal(uint64 epoch,address oracle,bytes oracleData,bytes32 safeTxHash)` with domain `{chainId, verifyingContract: consensus}` (`bindings.rs:93-103`, `hashing.rs:82-102`) matches the typehash comment and the parity vector at `hashing.rs:143-166`.
- **Salt reuse across two different votes.** Refuted. The salt is `HKDF-SHA256(ikm = private key, salt = "safenet-sentinel-reveal-salt", info = requestId)` (`hashing.rs:14, 49-53`; `core/tx/signer.rs:59-64`; `core/kdf.rs:19-27`), so two votes share a salt only if they share a `requestId` — and `SentinelOracleRequestMap.create` requires `state == NONE` and reverts `RequestAlreadyExists` otherwise (`contracts/src/libraries/SentinelOracleRequests.sol:388`), while `Consensus.proposeTransaction` additionally requires `$attestations[message].isZero` (`contracts/src/Consensus.sol:262`). A `requestId` can host exactly one commit-reveal game, so a revealed (hence public) salt is never reused. The `info` is a fixed-length 32-byte value, so there is no `info`-concatenation ambiguity either.
- **Salt predictable to an observer before reveal.** Refuted. The IKM is the signer's private key; an observer without it cannot derive the salt, and `hashing.rs:210-223` asserts the salt differs per request id. The key copy is zeroised after each derivation (`core/tx/signer.rs:60-63`).
- **The commit hash is not bound to the oracle, so a commitment could be replayed to another `SentinelOracle`.** Refuted: `requestId` is itself an EIP-712 hash over `oracle` (`hashing.rs:95-100`), so two oracles cannot share a request id.
- **`NewRequest` could arrive before `TransactionProposed`, stranding the FSM in `WaitingForRequest` forever.** Refuted. `Consensus.proposeTransaction` emits `TransactionProposed` at `contracts/src/Consensus.sol:264` and only then calls `IOracle(oracle).postRequest(...)` at `:266`, and the core watcher rejects any batch whose logs are not in `(block, index)` order (`core/state/mod.rs:207-211`). The ordering is guaranteed.
- **`WaitingForRequest` expiry could strand a decided vote.** Not reachable in practice for the same reason: both logs land in one batch, which is applied in full before any effect resume (`core/state/mod.rs:213-223`), so `request` is already `Some` when the engine resumes.
- **A duplicate `TransactionProposed` resets progress.** Refuted: guarded at `service.rs:119-126` and tested at `service.rs:1190-1204`.
- **A stale/replayed resume corrupts an advanced entry.** Refuted: guarded at `service.rs:156-170`, tested at `service.rs:1622-1631` and `1835-1850`.
- **A late resume could commit after the deadline.** Refuted: the entry has already expired (`service.rs:393-399`) so the resume is discarded (`service.rs:167-170`), and the queue never submits past `expires_at` (`core/tx/storage.rs:150-155`).
- **A re-delivered `Committed` double-counts `committed_count`.** Refuted in practice: `*committed_count += 1` at `service.rs:320` is unconditional (only the `self_committed` metric edge is guarded at `:325-329`), but a log is only re-delivered after a rollback that also restores the count (`core/state/mod.rs:182-189`), so the pair stays consistent. An over-count would in any case only delay the early finalise, never advance it.
- **A "narrow crash window" between the snapshot commit and the action enqueue loses a `Reveal`.** Refuted for the normal case. `Update::Logs` commits the snapshot (`core/state/mod.rs:236`) before `driver.rs:266-284` enqueues, but on restart the watcher rolls back to `indexed.safe` — strictly at or below the just-committed block — and replays it, re-emitting the action (`core/index/blocks.rs:261-266`). A residual edge remains when only a single snapshot is retained so no `Uncle` is emitted; recorded as observation 5.4.
- **`Message::NewBlock(n)` could be delivered twice, so `std::mem::take(reason)` (`service.rs:424`) could destroy the reveal reason.** Refuted: `Update::Block(New{number})` is only accepted when `status` is `Initialized` or `BlockPending{pending == number}` (`core/state/mod.rs:190-199`); a repeat falls through to `Err(Error::BadUpdate)` and the driver exits. And after `mem::take` the entry becomes `CollectingVotes`, which has no `reason` field.
- **Panics reachable from chain input or engine responses.** Refuted. `grep -n "unwrap\|expect(\|panic!\|unreachable!\|todo!\|\[0\]\|\[1\]\|as usize\|as u64\|as f64" crates/sentinel/src/*.rs` (test lines excluded) leaves only: `service.rs:328, 516, 590` (`U96 → u128 → as f64`, metrics only, `U96` always fits `u128`), `hashing.rs:57` (a `#[cfg_attr]` attribute, not code). `main.rs:53-60` and `engine.rs:158` use `saturating_*` plus `unwrap_or(u64::MAX)`, which cannot panic. `service.rs:127` uses `saturating_add`. `grep -rn "unsafe" crates/sentinel/src/` is empty. No slicing or indexing in non-test code.
- **`Operation` serialisation could fail on a hostile proposal and abort the check.** Not reachable: `bindings.rs:118-130`'s `_ =>` arm returns a serde error rather than panicking, and Solidity's `SafeTransaction.T.operation` is an `enum Operation { CALL, DELEGATECALL }` (`contracts/src/libraries/SafeTransaction.sol:36, 50`), so an out-of-range ordinal cannot be emitted. Even if it were, the failure surfaces as a `reqwest` error → `CheckOutcome::Unknown` → no vote (`engine.rs:181-187`), which is safe.
- **`reason` could be inflated by the engine to blow the reveal gas limit.** Refuted: the reason is `RuleId(u32, u32).to_string` (`engine.rs:45-49`, `service.rs:175`), at most 24 bytes.
- **The engine could change the vote after the commit.** Refuted: the verdict is consumed exactly once at the resume (`service.rs:156-171` removes the entry), and a second resume for the same id finds an advanced entry and is ignored (tested at `service.rs:1835-1850`).
- **Unlimited or misdirected ERC-20 approval.** Refuted: `approve(self.oracle, U256::from(bond_target))` (`service.rs:228-231`, `678-688`) — bounded, and the spender is always the configured oracle.
- **The signer key could reach logs, `Debug`, metrics or error messages.** Refuted for the sentinel: `Signer`'s `Debug` prints only the address (`core/tx/signer.rs:96-100`); `Config` derives `Debug` but `main.rs:39` logs only the file path; metric labels are fixed strings (`metrics.rs:27-34`, `89-98`); `engine.rs:182-185` logs the reqwest error, which contains the engine URL, not a key.
- **`Claimed` could be spoofed to mutate state.** Refuted: `handle_claimed` (`service.rs:584-593`) touches no state and is tested at `service.rs:1517-1543`.
- **`DisputeResolved.outcome` ordinal misalignment with the Solidity enum.** Refuted by inspection: the Rust `RequestState` (`bindings.rs:13-21`) declares `NONE, PENDING, FROZEN, RESOLVED_APPROVED, RESOLVED_DENIED, TIMED_OUT` in that order, matching `SentinelOracleRequest.State`, and the comment at `bindings.rs:7-12` states the ordinal requirement explicitly. `handle_resolved` compares against `RESOLVED_APPROVED` only (`service.rs:511`), which is used solely for a metric, not for the claim decision.
- **The `x-request-timeout` header could be inconsistent with the actual timeout.** Refuted: both come from the same `Duration` in one builder call (`engine.rs:155-161`), tested at `engine.rs:242-265`.

### 5. Observations (plausible, below the finding bar, or owned by another reviewer)

1. **No local loss budget or kill switch for engine mistakes (SEN-H9).** `service.rs:173-180` converts every verdict into a vote with no ceiling on cumulative slashing and no circuit breaker. Under A3 the engine is trusted, so this is a resilience gap rather than a defect: a bad engine deployment (for example an over-broad affirming checker) converts directly into lost disputes with nothing to stop it. Worth considering alongside the engine findings from R8/R9.
2. **`reqwest::Client::new` defaults (SEN-H14 — assigned to R10).** `engine.rs:113` builds the client with library defaults: redirects are followed, `HTTP(S)_PROXY`/`ALL_PROXY` environment variables are honoured, and there is no client-level timeout or connect timeout. Under A1 and A3 this is Informational, but a redirecting or proxied engine would send fully attacker-controlled Safe transaction contents somewhere else. Library-default behaviour is class `I` here (A6: no registry on disk).
3. **The config TOML text is not zeroised (SEN-H15 — assigned to R10).** `config.rs:63-64` reads the whole file, including the raw private key, into a `String` that is dropped without zeroisation, whereas the `Signer` deserialiser is careful to zeroise its own temporary (`core/tx/signer.rs:89-91`). Informational under A1.
4. **A single-snapshot restart emits no `Uncle`, so a crash between the snapshot commit and the action enqueue is unrecoverable.** `core/index/blocks.rs:261-266` only queues the `Uncle` when `indexed.safe + 1 <= indexed.latest`; immediately after a warp, `prune` can leave exactly one snapshot (`core/state/storage.rs:151-161`), making `safe == latest`. A crash in the window between `core/state/mod.rs:236` and `core/driver.rs:277` would then lose the actions from that batch permanently — for the sentinel, a `Claim` or a `Finalize` + `Claim`. Very narrow, and it is core's ordering rather than the sentinel's; flagged for R2 rather than filed here.
5. **The FSM never inspects `event.address`.** `service.rs:749-790` dispatches purely on the decoded event type; the only guard is the watcher's address filter over `[config.oracle, config.consensus]` (`main.rs:80`). `handle_oracle_transaction_proposed` does check `event.oracle != self.oracle` (`service.rs:105-107`), but no handler checks which contract emitted the log. Not exploitable with these two Safenet contracts, since their event signatures do not overlap; recorded because it is the sentinel instance of the map's cross-crate theme (CORE-H4).
6. **The engine request body's wire shape has no unit test.** `engine.rs:71-76` and `bindings.rs:77-91` produce the JSON by derived `Serialize`; nothing asserts it matches `crates/sentinel-engine/openapi.yaml`. `engine.rs:242-265` checks headers only. A field rename on either side would be caught only by the Anvil integration script.
7. **`Effect::EngineCheck.block` is the proposal's block, not the current head.** `service.rs:139-143` passes `block` from the `EventLog`. On a replay (F-SEN-001, F-SEN-011) that can be many blocks stale, so the engine's RPC-backed checkers would evaluate against a block the sentinel has long since passed. Whether that matters is engine-side (R8/R9).
8. **`SecurityCheck::timeout` is optional in the builder.** `engine.rs:154-161` — a caller that omits it gets no timeout at all, because `reqwest::Client::new` sets none (`engine.rs:113`). The only production caller does set it (`effect.rs:66`), so this is latent, not live; making the timeout a constructor parameter would remove the foot-gun.
9. **The response body is deserialised without a size bound.** `engine.rs:168` calls `.json` on the whole body. The per-request timeout bounds it in time, but not in memory. Informational under A3.
10. **`Dockerfile` hygiene (also in R10's scope).** `crates/sentinel/Dockerfile` has no `USER` directive, so the sentinel runs as root in the runtime image; the base images `rust:1-slim` and `debian:trixie-slim` are floating tags rather than digests; and there is no `HEALTHCHECK`. Informational under A1, and consistent across the workspace's Dockerfiles rather than specific to the sentinel.
11. **`hashing.rs:68-69` maps an invalid Safe operation to `CALL`.** `SafeOperation::try_from(u8).unwrap_or(SafeOperation::CALL)` silently coerces rather than failing. The function is test-only today (`#[cfg_attr(not(test), expect(dead_code))]` at `hashing.rs:57`) and the sentinel takes `safeTxHash` from the indexed topic rather than recomputing it (`service.rs:114`), so it is unreachable — but if `safe_tx_hash` is ever promoted to production use, that fallback would silently produce a wrong hash.
12. **`bindings.rs:49-55` and `:63` declare `hashCommitment` and `ERC20.allowance`, which are never called.** Dead bindings. Both would be useful for the reconciliation and allowance-check remediations proposed in F-SEN-001, F-SEN-002 and F-SEN-008.
13. **The oracle emits `DisputeTriggered`, `RequestTimedOut` and `OracleResult` (`contracts/src/SentinelOracle.sol:269, 275, 283`), none of which the sentinel watches.** The FSM infers all three locally, which is the shared root cause behind F-SEN-002, F-SEN-003 and F-SEN-005. Watching them would let the FSM correct its tally against the chain at zero extra RPC cost.

### 6. Gaps and caveats

- Nothing was compiled or executed (A9 FALSE), so no finding here exceeds `E2`.
- `alloy-sol-types` 1.6.0's `string` decoding behaviour is the pivotal unknown behind F-SEN-013 and cannot be resolved from this checkout (`~/.cargo/registry` is absent, there is no `vendor/`). QA should settle it first.
- The engine's own latency profile, the saturation point behind F-SEN-004, and the real deployment's `COMMIT_WINDOW`/`REVEAL_WINDOW`/`ARBITRATION_TIMEOUT`/fee-token identity are all unknown here; several severity calls (F-SEN-004, F-SEN-008, F-SEN-003) would move with those numbers.
- Core files were read only in the ranges listed in Section 1 and are cited as supporting basis, never as findings; the definitive review of those files belongs to R1, R2 and R3.

## R8 — engine API, chain access, contract decoding

Reviewer R8. Scope per `codebase-map.md` §9: `sentinel-engine/src/api/*`, `engine/*`, `contracts/*`, `{config,main}.rs`, `openapi.yaml`, `sentinel-engine.sample.toml`, `sentinel-engine/Dockerfile` (1,642 lines of Rust + 3 non-Rust files). Finding ID range `F-ENG-001` … `F-ENG-029`. Run mode: READ-ONLY, no toolchain (A9 false), so nothing below is class `E1`.

### Hypotheses considered and REJECTED

Each entry names the citation that refuted it.

#### From the map / analysis (my assigned leads)

- **ENG-H10 "no timeouts" — CONFIRMED, filed as F-ENG-005.** Not rejected. The analysis's claim is accurate: `api/mod.rs:48-50` discards the parsed budget, `api/mod.rs:25-31` adds only `TraceLayer`. Refinement the analysis missed: `crates/sentinel-engine/Cargo.toml:7-21` does not take the workspace's `tower` and takes `tower-http` with only the workspace `trace` feature (root `Cargo.toml:24`), so `TimeoutLayer`, `ConcurrencyLimitLayer`, `RequestBodyLimitLayer` and `CatchPanicLayer` are not merely unused — they are not compiled in.
- **ENG-H11 "unbounded recursion in `decode_target_effects`" — CONFIRMED AS LATENT ONLY, filed as F-ENG-006 at Low.** The reachability shield is real and I re-derived it rather than trusting the analysis: `decode_target_effects` (`target_effects.rs:46-52`) is called from exactly one place, `excessive_approval.rs:20` (grep over `crates/`, no other caller), which is checker #6 (`main.rs:63`); `decode_multi_send_call` (`multi_send.rs:143-151`) recurses only into `Operation::DelegateCall` sub-calls; and `check_multi_send` (`base.rs:205-213`, checker #3 at `main.rs:60`) requires every sub-tx to satisfy `check_calls(sub_tx) || (allows_delegate_calls && check_delegate_calls(sub_tx))` — a nested MultiSend sub-call fails `check_calls` (`base.rs:88-90`, not a `Call`) and fails `check_delegate_calls` (`base.rs:151-192`, a MultiSend address is in none of `MIGRATION_CONTRACTS`/`SIGN_MESSAGE_LIBS`/`CREATE_CALL_CONTRACTS`), so base returns `Insecure R-4.2` and the chain breaks at `engine/mod.rs:66-68`. **Maximum reachable recursion depth is therefore 2**, not unbounded.
- **ENG-H12 "shutdown is not graceful" — CONFIRMED, filed as F-ENG-007** (`main.rs:79-84`, no `.with_graceful_shutdown`).
- **ENG-H13 "failure-abstain indistinguishable from policy-abstain" — CONFIRMED as a fact but NOT filed by me.** `engine/mod.rs:46-47` shows `Verdict::Abstain` is a unit variant with no reason field, so the two are the same bytes. The _mechanism_ that makes it matter, however, lives entirely in `checkers/address_poisoning.rs` and `checkers/cow.rs` (R9's scope) and in the sentinel's metric (R7's). I record it here as an observation so it is not lost, rather than filing a duplicate against R9's files.
- **ENG-H14 "docs understate external dependencies" — NOT FILED, out of bounds.** The brief §4 lists `docs/` as reference-only material with no findings on it. The claim is true (`docs/sentinel-engine.md` line ~88: "The address-poisoning check (the only check backed by RPC-derived state)" while `checkers/cow.rs` makes outbound HTTPS), but it is a `docs/` defect. Recorded as an observation for R10/documentation. The _machine-readable_ half of the same problem — `openapi.yaml`, which IS in my scope — is filed as F-ENG-008.
- **"Panics/500s from malformed bodies or calldata: none found" (analysis §8) — I RE-DERIVED THIS INDEPENDENTLY AND AGREE for my files.** A grep for `unwrap|expect(|panic!|unreachable!|todo!|assert|as (u|i|f|usize)|from_slice|<<|>>` over all eleven assigned `.rs` files returns, outside `#[cfg(test)]`, only: `multi_send.rs:106` `Address::from_slice(cursor.read(20)?)` (exactly 20 bytes or `None`, `multi_send.rs:181-185`), `multi_send.rs:107-108` `U256::from_be_slice(cursor.read(32)?)` ×2 (exactly 32 bytes; `from_be_slice` panics only above 32), `multi_send.rs:109` `Bytes::copy_from_slice(cursor.read(data_len)?)` (bounds-checked before the copy), `multi_send.rs:171` `unwrap_or_else` (not a panic), and `transaction.rs:37` `*self as _` on a fieldless `#[repr(u8)]` enum. **There is no `unwrap`, `expect`, `panic!`, `unreachable!`, `todo!`, index or slice expression in non-test code anywhere in my scope.** The decoders are total.
- **"Unbounded allocation from an attacker-supplied length field" (my own lead, and the headline risk the launch message flagged) — REFUTED for `decode_multi_send`.** `multi_send.rs:108` converts the 32-byte `dataLength` via `U256 -> usize try_into.ok?`, and `multi_send.rs:109` then passes it to `Cursor::read`, which is `mem::take(&mut self.0).split_at_checked(len)?` (`multi_send.rs:181-185`). `split_at_checked` returns `None` **before** any allocation when `len` exceeds the remaining bytes, so `Bytes::copy_from_slice` never allocates more than the input already contains. A `dataLength` of `2^40` on a 1 KiB body allocates nothing and returns `None`. Memory is O(body), not O(declared length).
- **"A MultiSend whose declared length disagrees with its actual bytes" — REFUTED as a hazard.** Every read in `decode_multi_send` (`multi_send.rs:99-130`) goes through the same checked cursor; truncation mid-entry, a trailing partial entry, or an oversize `dataLength` all return `None` from `decode_multi_send`, which `decode_multi_send_call` turns into `None` (`multi_send.rs:160-163`) and `base.rs:206-208` turns into `Insecure R-4.2`. No panic, no partial state.
- **"Zero-length / truncated / oversize calldata" — REFUTED.** `data.is_empty` is an explicit early return (`target_effects.rs:68-70`); a `dataLength` of 0 yields `split_at_checked(0) == Some((&[], rest))`; an entirely empty blob yields `Some(vec![])` (the `while let Some(operation) = cursor.next` at `multi_send.rs:99` never enters); calldata shorter than 4 bytes fails every `abi_decode` in `target_effects.rs:71-129` and every `starts_with(SELECTOR)` in `base.rs`.
- **"`operation` byte outside {0,1} in a packed sub-transaction" — REFUTED.** `multi_send.rs:100-104` returns `None` for anything but 0/1. At the JSON layer, `transaction.rs:41-50` rejects it at deserialisation (pinned by `transaction.rs:165-169`), so the handler never runs.
- **"Body-size / JSON-depth bomb" — NOT REFUTABLE OFFLINE, downgraded to an observation.** `api/mod.rs:25-31` sets no `DefaultBodyLimit`, so axum 0.8.9's default (documented as 2 MiB) applies, and `serde_json` 1.0.150 has its own recursion cap. Both are class `I` under A6 (no registry on disk). All quantities are hex _strings_ (`transaction.rs:59-75`), not JSON numbers, so there is no numeric-parse blowup.
- **"Header injection / oversized header values" — REFUTED.** `extractors.rs:52-69` is the only header code: absent header -> `Ok(None)`; present -> `HeaderValue::to_str` (rejects non-visible-ASCII) then `T::from_str`, both mapped to a fixed `(StatusCode::BAD_REQUEST, &'static str)` (`extractors.rs:18,22-25,39,43-46`). No attacker string is echoed into the response, into a log field, or into a URL. Both extractors run **before** the `Json` body extractor (`api/mod.rs:33-37`), so a bad header short-circuits before the body is read. `Duration::from_millis(u64::MAX)` (`extractors.rs:48`) cannot panic. A duplicate header takes the first value (`HeaderMap::get`) — no smuggling surface here, since the engine is the terminal server.
- **"`x-request-id` reflected into logs unsanitised" — REFUTED.** `api/mod.rs:44-46` records it only after it has parsed as a `B256` (`extractors.rs:21`), i.e. 32 bytes re-rendered by alloy's `Display`. Arbitrary text cannot reach the span field.
- **"Wire drift between `openapi.yaml` and the handler's _schemas_" — REFUTED for the happy path.** Field-by-field: `openapi.yaml:101-128` lists the same twelve `camelCase` members as `transaction.rs:56-76`, both `additionalProperties: false` / `deny_unknown_fields`; `openapi.yaml:54` `required: [block, transaction]` matches `api/mod.rs:16-22`; `openapi.yaml:129-133` `Operation enum [0,1]` matches `transaction.rs:20-29`; `openapi.yaml:161-168` `RuleId` pattern `^R-[0-9]+\.[0-9]+$` admits all six `rule.rs:105-114` codes; `openapi.yaml:86-95`'s `secure`/`insecure`/`abstain` discriminator matches `engine/mod.rs:36-48`'s `tag = "verdict"`, `rename_all = "lowercase"`; and `openapi.yaml:4` `version: 0.2.0` matches `crates/sentinel-engine/Cargo.toml:3`. The gap is in the **response set** and the timeout semantics only — F-ENG-008.
- **"Impl stricter than the spec (would reject honest sentinel traffic)" — REFUTED; the drift is the other way.** `openapi.yaml:169-174` `Digest` is lower-case-only and `0x`-required while `B256::from_str` accepts either case; `openapi.yaml:181-186` `Quantity` demands minimal lower-case hex while ruint accepts more. Being _more_ permissive than the published contract cannot reject a conforming caller.
- **`safenet_guard::AnnouncedTransaction` selector mirror — REFUTED as a defect.** `bindings.rs:42-52` declares `address to; uint256 value; bytes data; uint8 operation; uint256 safeTxGas; uint256 baseGas; uint256 gasPrice; address gasToken; address refundReceiver`, field-for-field and in order identical to `contracts/src/libraries/TransactionAnnouncement.sol:27-37`, whose `Enum.Operation` ABI-encodes as `uint8`. The derived selector is therefore right (the `uint8`-for-enum step is class `I`: the Solidity ABI rule, not something I executed).
- **"Charter networks vs the engine's supported chain set" — REFUTED.** Article I (`safenet-charter@44a1e53:Safenet_Arbitration_Charter.md:36-41`) scopes the rules to "Ethereum / Arbitrum / Gnosis Chain", which is exactly the `{1, 100, 42161}` set `checkers/cow.rs:88` claims. (`cow.rs` is R9's file; recorded so the claim is not re-litigated.)
- **"R-4.6 is cited as Article IV Part B but might be Part A" — REFUTED.** The Charter has `### Part A — Deterministic rules` at line 490 covering R-4.1 (500) and R-4.2 (546), and `### Part B — Target manipulation` at line 577 covering R-4.3 (588), R-4.4 (611), R-4.5 (635) and R-4.6 (659) with no third Part heading. Every Part attribution in `rule.rs:16,20,24,28,58,69` is correct.
- **"`RuleId` round-trip / serialisation defect" — REFUTED.** `rule.rs:83-101` serialises via `code` and deserialises via `from_code`, rejecting unknown codes with a `de::Error::custom`; `rule.rs:137-163` pins both directions for all six variants and the rejection message. The `Verdict::Insecure { rule: RuleId }` type (`engine/mod.rs:42-45`) makes "insecure without a rule code" unrepresentable.
- **"`block` can widen the address-poisoning scan window" — REFUTED (and it is R9's file anyway).** `CheckContext` carries only `block: u64` (`engine/mod.rs:23-33`) and `api/mod.rs:52-54` copies it straight from the request; the window arithmetic (`address_poisoning.rs:189,192`) is `to.saturating_sub(lookback) ..= to`, whose span is `<= lookback` for every `u64`.
- **"`CheckRequest` could be deserialised with a missing field defaulting to zero" — REFUTED.** Neither `api/mod.rs:14-22` nor `transaction.rs:55-76` uses `#[serde(default)]` on any member; only `config.rs:25,28,53` do, and those are operator-side.
- **"An `else if` ordering bug in `decode_call` lets one selector shadow another" — REFUTED.** The eight arms at `target_effects.rs:71-129` dispatch on eight _distinct_ 4-byte selectors, and alloy's `abi_decode` checks the selector before the body, so arm order cannot matter. The one genuine collision is documented and deliberate: ERC-20 `approve(address,uint256)` and ERC-721 `approve(address,uint256)` share a selector (`target_effects.rs:29-31`), as do the two `setApprovalForAll` (`target_effects.rs:33-34`).
- **"Checker-chain semantics let an error be mistaken for a verdict" — REFUTED at the engine layer.** `Checker::check` returns `Verdict` (not `Result`), and `engine/mod.rs:57-72` has no fallible step: the loop can only produce one of the three `Verdict` variants, defaulting to `Abstain` on an empty chain (`engine/mod.rs:62`). There is no path where an internal error is reported as `Secure`.
- **"`decode_multi_send` ignoring `allows_delegate_calls` is a bypass" — REFUTED.** `multi_send.rs:92-133` decodes `DelegateCall` sub-entries regardless of deployment, but it _returns_ the flag to the caller (`multi_send.rs:164`), and `base.rs:210-212` is the security decision point and does gate on it. `decode_target_effects` dropping the flag (`target_effects.rs:47`) only affects effect enumeration, never an allow decision.

#### My own leads

- **"`main.rs` builds the chain in an order that lets a later checker's `Insecure` be suppressed" — CONFIRMED as a fact but assigned to R9.** `main.rs:57-73` + `engine/mod.rs:62-69`. This is ENG-H1..H7's shared root cause and R9 owns `checkers/*`; filing it from `main.rs` would duplicate. Recorded as an observation.
- **"`RefundChecker`'s `chain_id = 0` bug has a sibling in `decode_multi_send`" — PARTIALLY CONFIRMED, recorded as an observation, not filed.** `multi_send.rs:116-129` builds every sub-transaction with `chain_id: U256::ZERO` and zeroed `safe_tx_gas`/`base_gas`/`gas_price`/`gas_token`/`refund_receiver`/`nonce` — the same shape as the `..Default::default` at `refund.rs:105-117` that ENG-H1 says makes the refund checker dead. Any consumer of `sub_transactions` (`cow.rs:429`, `staking.rs:93`) that reads one of those six fields on a sub-transaction silently reads zero. Today `cow.rs`/`staking.rs` read only `to`/`value`/`data`/`operation` on sub-calls and take `chain_id` from the top-level transaction, so nothing is wrong _yet_; but this is a loaded footgun in a decoder whose sibling has already fired once. It belongs to R9 to confirm no sub-call consumer reads a zeroed field.
- **`Cursor::read` poisons itself on a failed read — REAL but with no impact today.** `multi_send.rs:182` does `mem::take(&mut self.0)` _before_ `split_at_checked(len)?`, so when the read fails the `?` returns while `self.0` has already been replaced with the empty slice: the cursor silently becomes exhausted rather than staying put. Every current caller propagates the `None` straight out of `decode_multi_send` (`multi_send.rs:106-109`) and drops the cursor, so the poisoned state is never observed. A future caller that tried to recover from a failed read (peek, or "skip this entry") would silently see an empty rest-of-blob. Observation, not a finding — no reachable behaviour today.
- **"An attacker-supplied dynamic-array length in `abi_decode` pre-allocates" — could not be settled offline; observation, ~20%.** `erc1155::safeBatchTransferFromCall` (`bindings.rs:84`, decoded at `target_effects.rs:121-128`) has two `uint256[]` parameters, the classic shape for a decoder that does `Vec::with_capacity(len)` before bounds-checking `len`. alloy-sol-types 1.6.0 (`Cargo.lock:678-679`) is believed to bounds-check the sequence length against the remaining buffer, but **A6 applies: the source is not on disk and I did not execute anything**, so this is class `I` and below the 40% bar. Flagged for QA once a toolchain exists: one `#[test]` decoding `safeBatchTransferFrom` with an `ids` length word of `0xffffffff` and no body settles it.
- **`DEPLOYMENTS` covers MultiSend 1.3.0 / 1.4.1 / 1.5.0 only — observation, not filed.** The eight entries at `multi_send.rs:27-68` are two 1.5.0, two 1.4.1 and four 1.3.0 (canonical + eip155, MultiSend + MultiSendCallOnly) — the same version floor as `base.rs:186-191`'s `CREATE_CALL_CONTRACTS`, which carries explicit `// 1.3.0 / 1.4.1 / 1.5.0` comments. A Safe still batching through a pre-1.3.0 MultiSend deployment therefore fails `known_deployment` (`multi_send.rs:73-78`), so `decode_multi_send_call` returns `None` (`multi_send.rs:152-155`) and `base.rs:206-208` denies it `Insecure R-4.2` — a _false denial of an honest batch_. I did not file this because I cannot verify offline either the canonical pre-1.3.0 addresses or whether Safenet's guard supports Safes of that vintage at all; asserting an address from memory would be exactly the hallucination the Critic exists to catch. Worth one lookup with network access.
- **`MultiSendVersion` per-deployment tagging (engine checklist item 6) — NOT VERIFIED, observation.** `multi_send.rs:111-114` rewrites `to == 0` to `safe` for the two `V150Plus` entries and leaves it as the zero address for the six `Legacy` ones; a mis-tagged deployment would be an R-4.1 bypass, since `base.rs:87-90` treats a call to the zero address as a call to "another contract" and allows it. Settling this needs Safe's `MultiSend.sol` per version, which is **not in this repo** (`contracts/src` has no Safe sources) and which I have no network to fetch. Class `I`; I decline to guess. This is the one item in my scope I could not discharge.
- **Dockerfile hardening — observation, deferred to R10.** `Dockerfile:16-28` has no `USER` directive, so the engine runs as root in the runtime image; there is also no `HEALTHCHECK` and no `EXPOSE`, and both base images float (`rust:1-slim`, `debian:trixie-slim`) although the build is `--locked` (`Dockerfile:11`). A `find . -name Dockerfile` + grep shows **none** of the four Dockerfiles in the repo sets `USER`, so this is a repo-wide pattern and belongs to R10's cross-cutting sweep, not to a `sentinel-engine`-only finding.
- **`panic = "abort"` would turn any reachable panic into a process kill — REFUTED.** The root `Cargo.toml` has no `[profile.release]` section at all, so unwinding is the default; `crates/sentinel-engine/Cargo.toml` sets no profile either. Combined with the panic census above (no reachable panic in scope), the "panic -> 500 -> missing vote" path in PROMPT §8 has no instance in my files. Note for the Critic: because `tower-http`'s `catch-panic` feature is **not** enabled (root `Cargo.toml:24` takes only `trace`), a panic anywhere in the checker chain would drop the connection rather than return a 500 — the sentinel would see a transport error, not a status code. That changes the shape of the symptom, not the presence of a defect.
- **"Missing auth / rate limiting on the engine API" — Informational by A3, NOT filed.** `api/mod.rs:25-31` adds no auth layer, which `docs/sentinel-engine.md` states as intentional ("The API currently specifies no authentication or rate limiting... Do not expose the reference API publicly without adding appropriate access controls at the deployment boundary"). I looked for a bypass _inside_ the co-deployed boundary and found none: the only listener the engine opens is `TcpListener::bind(config.bind_address)` (`main.rs:75`) defaulting to `127.0.0.1:5473` (`config.rs:57-59`), plus the safenet-core metrics listener, and the sample config leaves `bind_address` commented out (`sentinel-engine.sample.toml:14-17`). Nothing in scope widens the bind address on its own. Per the launch brief, not inflated.
- **"`config.rs` accepts a dangerous default" — REFUTED for the fields that matter.** `rpc` and `engine.blocklist` and `engine.address_poisoning_lookback_blocks` are all **required** (no `#[serde(default)]`, `config.rs:23,39,42`), both tables are `deny_unknown_fields` (`config.rs:20,36`), `bind_address` defaults to loopback rather than `0.0.0.0` (`config.rs:57-59`), and `parses_sample_config` (`config.rs:146-153`) pins the shipped sample against the schema. The one real gap — no _cross-field_ validation — is F-ENG-009.
- **"`sentinel-engine.sample.toml` drifts from the schema" — REFUTED.** Every key in the sample (`rpc`, `bind_address`, `engine.blocklist`, `engine.address_poisoning_lookback_blocks`, `engine.address_poisoning_max_block_range`, `observability.log_filter`, `observability.metrics_address`) exists in `config.rs:19-55` plus `safenet_core::observability::Config`, and `config.rs:146-153` is a test that actually loads the file from `CARGO_MANIFEST_DIR`. The sample contains no secrets — the only values are a public RPC URL and an empty blocklist.

### Observations (plausible, below the 40% bar — not findings)

1. **Failure-abstain vs policy-abstain are the same bytes** (`engine/mod.rs:46-47`), and the engine exports no verdict metric of its own, so a degraded RPC or CoW API silently converts the engine into "abstain everything" with only `warn!` lines to show for it. Mechanism lives in R9's and R7's files; ENG-H13.
2. **The whole `Insecure`-suppression class** (`main.rs:57-73` + `engine/mod.rs:62-69`): six checkers can affirm `Secure` and the first non-abstain wins, so every deny-only checker placed after an affirmer is unreachable for the shapes that affirmer accepts. ENG-H1..H7, R9's scope.
3. **`decode_multi_send` zeroes six of the twelve `SafeTransaction` fields on every sub-transaction** (`multi_send.rs:116-129`) — the same footgun that ENG-H1 says already fired in `refund.rs`. R9 should confirm no `sub_transactions` consumer reads one.
4. **`Cursor::read` leaves the cursor empty after a failed read** (`multi_send.rs:182`, `mem::take` before the fallible `split_at_checked`). No caller observes it today.
5. **Attacker-supplied `uint256[]` lengths in `safeBatchTransferFrom` decoding** (`bindings.rs:84` / `target_effects.rs:121-128`): allocation behaviour is alloy-internal and unverifiable offline (A6). ~20%. One decode test settles it.
6. **`multi_send.rs:27-68` covers only MultiSend 1.3.0+**; an honest batch through an older canonical deployment is denied `R-4.2` rather than allowed. Needs one address lookup.
7. **`MultiSendVersion` tagging is unverified** — Safe's `MultiSend.sol` is not in this repo, so I could not confirm that exactly the two `V150Plus` entries redirect `to == 0` to `address(this)`. Engine checklist item 6 remains open.
8. **The Dockerfile runs the engine as root** and both base images float; repo-wide, R10.
9. **`docs/sentinel-engine.md` omits the CoW API dependency** (ENG-H14). Reference-only material, so no finding; R10/documentation.
10. **Charter § 2.18 constrains the escape hatch to the Guard's own functions** ("Calls to the Safenet Guard's `announceTransaction` and `cancelAnnouncement` functions are auto-allowed by the Guard", `safenet-charter@44a1e53:Safenet_Arbitration_Charter.md:352`) while `checkers/escape_hatch.rs` affirms the shape for **any** `to`. This is ENG-H5 and `escape_hatch.rs` is R9's file — recorded here only so the Charter quote that settles it is on the record. § 2.18 line 354 also explicitly says the Guard does **not** constrain the announcement transaction's gas/refund parameters and that any `gasPrice == 0` requirement is "outside this Charter", which is relevant to how R9 frames ENG-H4.

### 3. Findings filed

| ID | Severity (reviewer) | One line | Self-estimate |
| --- | --- | --- | --: |
| F-ENG-030 | Critical | `NestedSafeChecker` affirms any `execTransaction`-shaped `Call` regardless of `value` → native drain rated `secure` | 88% |
| F-ENG-031 | Critical | Four affirmers never read the refund leg; the native-refund drain rides on a `secure` verdict (`known`: refund.rs:83, :93) | 90% |
| F-ENG-032 | High | `RefundChecker`'s synthetic transfer has `chainId = 0`, so the delegated check always abstains — the checker is dead | 93% |
| F-ENG-033 | Critical | `AddressPoisoningChecker` affirms from history on an attacker-chosen `to` and ignores `value` | 85% |
| F-ENG-034 | High | `EscapeHatchChecker` affirms for any `to` and runs before the blocklist → R-4.6 bypass; diverges from `_isAutoAllowed` and Charter §2.18 | 82% |
| F-ENG-035 | High | Blocklist sees only the top-level `to`; a flagged token recipient with prior history is affirmed `secure` | 84% |
| F-ENG-036 | High | R-4.5 implemented as `== U256::MAX`; `approve(X, 2^256-2)` to an established spender is `secure`; `increaseAllowance` is not decoded at all | 80% |
| F-ENG-037 | Medium | CoW TWAP approval tolerance is `total + (n-1)` with attacker-chosen `n` → near-unlimited relayer approval `secure` | 83% |
| F-ENG-038 | Low | CoW shape recognisers are looser than their decoders; a decoy trigger turns a dangling relayer approval into `abstain` | 84% |
| F-ENG-039 | Medium | `BaseChecker`'s R-4.1/R-4.2 allow-lists are far wider than the Charter's exception lists (owner/threshold/guard/module/migration, batched, non-zero `value`) | 78% |
| F-ENG-040 | Low (`known`) | Every MultiSend denial cites R-4.2 even for R-4.1 sub-call failures (`base.rs:198`) | 95% |
| F-ENG-041 | Low (`known`) | Novel recipient with no comparison set only abstains (`address_poisoning.rs:303`) | 95% |
| F-ENG-042 | Medium | Denials issued from an evidence set bounded by recency and by undetectable `eth_getLogs` truncation → wrong `insecure` on honest payments | 70% |
| F-ENG-043 | Low | CoW lookup has no client timeout and puts an unbounded, unvalidated `orderUid` in the URL (overlaps R8's ENG-H10) | 88% |

Known-item coverage (A12): `refund.rs:83`/`:93` → F-ENG-031 (tagged `known`); `base.rs:198` → F-ENG-040; `address_poisoning.rs:303` → F-ENG-041. `api/mod.rs:48` and the two `crates/sentinel` items are outside my scope.

### 4. Seeded leads — disposition

| Lead | Disposition | Where / why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ENG-H1 (refund dead, chain 0) | **Confirmed** | F-ENG-032. `refund.rs:105-117` `..Default::default`; `SafeTransaction` derives `Default` (`engine/transaction.rs:55`); `address_poisoning.rs:312`. |
| ENG-H2 (NestedSafe affirms, ignores `value`) | **Confirmed** | F-ENG-030. `nested.rs:42-47` — the predicate has no `value`/`gas_price` term. |
| ENG-H3 (AddressPoisoning affirms on attacker-chosen `to`, ignores `value`) | **Confirmed**, split in two | F-ENG-033. `decode_target` (`:116-139`) has no `value` term; the filter is on `transaction.to` (`:194`). |
| ENG-H4 (refund leg unvetted behind affirmers) | **Confirmed**, strengthened | F-ENG-031. The strongest trigger is `StakingChecker`, which is pure — no RPC, no CoW API, fully deterministic. |
| ENG-H5 (EscapeHatch any `to`, before Blocklist) | **Confirmed, but the analysis text is stale** | F-ENG-034. The current code _does_ require `value == 0` and `gas_price == 0` (`escape_hatch.rs:53`), unlike the analysis's quote. Only the `to` gap and the ordering remain. |
| ENG-H6 (Blocklist top-level `to` only) | **Confirmed**, re-centred | F-ENG-035. Charter §2.4's "not merely an intermediate contract address" makes the ERC-20-recipient case, not MultiSend, the central one; Trigger B upgrades it from missed denial to false `secure`. |
| ENG-H7 (`approve(X, MAX-1)` affirmed) | **Confirmed**, extended | F-ENG-036, plus the `increaseAllowance` decoding gap, which is new. |
| ENG-H8 (TWAP tolerance sized by `n`) | **Confirmed** | F-ENG-037. `cow.rs:552-554`; `checked_mul` does not stop `partSellAmount = 0`. |
| ENG-H9 (recogniser/decoder divergence) | **Confirmed** | F-ENG-038. `cow.rs:478-483` vs `:561-569`; `:492-499` vs `:531-542`. |
| ENG-H10 to H14 | Out of my scope (R8) except the two `checkers/cow.rs` facts, filed as F-ENG-043. |

### 5. Hypotheses I considered and **rejected**, with the citation that refuted each

1. **CoW API response spoofing lets an attacker fabricate an order.** Rejected: `check_presignature_batch` recomputes the EIP-712 digest and compares it byte-for-byte with the requested UID before using any field (`cow.rs:296-303`), and the recomputation is pinned against a real mainnet order (`cow.rs:1379-1406`). A response that does not reproduce the UID yields `Abstain`.
2. **`compute_order_uid`'s `expect` at `cow.rs:130` is an attacker-reachable panic (HTTP 500).** Rejected: its only caller is `check_presignature_batch`, which returns `Abstain` at `cow.rs:282-284` unless `order_api_base_url` matched 1 / 100 / 42161 — all within `u64`. Latent, not reachable; noted as an observation below.
3. **`MultiSend` decoding can panic on a hostile blob.** Rejected: `Cursor::read` uses `split_at_checked` (`multi_send.rs:181-185`), the `dataLength` conversion is `try_into.ok?` (`:108`), and an operation byte outside {0,1} returns `None` (`:100-104`). Total.
4. **`decode_target_effects`' unbounded recursion is reachable (ENG-H11).** Rejected for the _current_ chain order: only `ExcessiveApprovalChecker` calls it (`excessive_approval.rs:20`), and `BaseChecker` runs first and denies any batch containing a delegatecall to an address outside `check_delegate_calls`' lists — a nested MultiSend address is not on those lists (`base.rs:151-193`, `:210-212`). Latent only; R8 owns `target_effects.rs`.
5. **`block_chunks` can loop forever or explode the range.** Rejected: `from = to.saturating_sub(lookback)` so `from <= to` always; `end = start.saturating_add(max_range).min(to)` and `done = end >= to` (`address_poisoning.rs:255-266`); the unit test pins the boundaries (`:441-448`).
6. **`nibbles`/`is_lookalike` can index out of bounds.** Rejected: `out[2*i]`/`out[2*i+1]` with `i < 20` (`address_poisoning.rs:63-70`); `zip` bounds both iterators.
7. **An `ExactMatch` can be produced from a _partial_ scan and so is unsound.** Rejected: the early return at `address_poisoning.rs:218-220` fires on a log that was actually returned, so partiality can only _hide_ evidence, never invent it. (The reverse direction — partiality producing a wrong denial — is F-ENG-042.)
8. **`transferFrom` where `from != safe` can seed evidence.** Rejected: `decode_target` requires `call.from == tx.safe` (`address_poisoning.rs:129`).
9. **`approve(spender, 0)` is denied as a poisoned target, blocking revocations.** Rejected: zero amounts return `None` from `decode_target` (`address_poisoning.rs:136`) and zero-amount logs are skipped as evidence (`:215-217`).
10. **`StakingChecker` can be fed a batch whose sub-calls carry native value.** Rejected: all three helpers require `!tx.value.is_zero` to be false (`staking.rs:157, 168, 179`), and the outer `value` of a MultiSend delegatecall is not forwarded out of the Safe.
11. **`StakingChecker` sums two `approve` calls incorrectly.** Rejected: any remainder other than 0, 1 or 2 calls abstains (`staking.rs:114`), and the module doc explains the deliberate refusal to sum (`staking.rs:38-45`).
12. **`check_pair` accepts `[stake, approve]` (approval after the spend).** Rejected: `check_pair` requires `staking_approval_amount(first)` and `stake_amount(second)` in that order (`staking.rs:140`); the reversed pair returns `Abstain` (`:149`).
13. **A CoW presignature batch can commit the Safe to someone else's order.** Rejected as a practical exploit: `presignature_order_uid` requires `signed == true` (`cow.rs:567`) and CoW's `setPreSignature` requires the UID's embedded owner to be `msg.sender`, so an order owned by another address reverts and the whole MultiSend reverts atomically. **But** the engine never checks `order.owner == safe` itself — kept as an observation below, because the safety of the affirmation rests entirely on an external contract not in this checkout.
14. **`CancellationChecker` can be tricked with a non-zero field.** Rejected: it compares the whole struct against a canonical all-default value (`cancellation.rs:16-27`), and `SafeTransaction` derives `PartialEq` over all twelve fields (`engine/transaction.rs:55`).
15. **`EscapeHatchChecker` can carry a refund.** Rejected: `gas_price` must be zero (`escape_hatch.rs:53`), and Safe only calls `handlePayment` when `gasPrice > 0` — the module doc states this and it is consistent with `SafenetGuard.sol:352`.
16. **Selector collisions weaponise `EscapeHatchChecker`/`NestedSafeChecker` against an existing privileged contract.** Rejected as impractical (~2^-32 per function); neither F-ENG-030 nor F-ENG-034 needs one.
17. **`MultiSendVersion::Legacy` deployments also redirect `to == 0` to the Safe, making `base.rs:91-93` an R-4.1 bypass.** Not refuted and not confirmed — `MultiSend.sol` is not in this checkout, so any claim about the legacy deployments' zero-address semantics is class `I`. Left to R8 (who owns `contracts/multi_send.rs`) and recorded as an observation. The rewrite is at `multi_send.rs:111-114`.
18. **A hostile JSON body panics or exhausts memory in a checker.** Rejected within my scope: no `unwrap`, `expect`, `panic!`, indexing or unchecked arithmetic exists in any checker's non-test code except `cow.rs:130` (item 2 above); every amount operation uses `checked_`/`saturating_` (`cow.rs:540, 553`, `refund.rs:110-112`, `address_poisoning.rs:189`).
19. **`RefundChecker` could affirm and short-circuit the chain.** Rejected: `deny_or_abstain` squashes `Secure` (`refund.rs:68-73`) and a unit test pins it (`:188-191`).
20. **The `x-request-timeout` / server-deadline gap is mine to file.** Rejected as scope: it lives in `api/mod.rs`, R8's files. Only the two `checkers/cow.rs` facts are filed here (F-ENG-043).

### 6. Observations (plausible, below the 40% bar — recorded, not filed)

- **`CowChecker` never checks `order.owner == transaction.safe`** (`cow.rs:295-317`). The recomputed UID binds `owner`, and `CowOrder::receiver` falls back to `owner` only when `receiver` is null/zero, so an order owned by A with `receiver` explicitly set to the Safe passes the `receiver != safe` test and can reach `Secure`. Safe today only because CoW's `setPreSignature` rejects a UID whose owner is not `msg.sender` — a fact from outside this checkout. A one-line `order.owner == safe` check would remove the dependency.
- **`CowChecker` gates on `transaction.chain_id` alone and never compares it with the configured provider's chain id** (`cow.rs:421-427`; contrast `address_poisoning.rs:312`). `StakingChecker` likewise (`staking.rs:89`). Neither reads RPC state, so no stale evidence is used — but `AGENTS.md`'s rule that each checker verifies `chain_id` itself is only satisfied by `AddressPoisoningChecker`, and nothing central enforces it. An engine pointed at Gnosis will still answer `Secure` for a chain-1 staking batch.
- **`recipients.iter.find(...)` iterates a `HashSet`** (`address_poisoning.rs:338`), so which `established` address is named in the log line is non-deterministic across runs. The verdict is not affected (any lookalike denies), but two engines can log different evidence for the same denial.
- **`compute_order_uid`'s `expect` (`cow.rs:130`) is a latent panic** guarded only by the caller's chain check. Any future caller reintroduces an HTTP 500 path. A `u64::try_from(...).ok?` would remove it.
- **`Verdict::Secure`'s own doc comment says "All configured checks consider the transaction secure"** (`engine/mod.rs:39-40`), which the first-wins loop at `:62-69` makes false. Doc/code mismatch at the exact point where Charter §3.7 requires the opposite semantics; R8 owns the file, so it is recorded here rather than filed.
- **`is_lookalike`'s 4+4-nibble threshold and vanity addresses.** Protocol addresses mined for leading zeros or vanity prefixes are common; two such addresses in one Safe's history could coincidentally trip the test if they also share four trailing nibbles. No concrete pair was found in this checkout, so this is an observation, not the basis of F-ENG-042.
- **`base.rs`'s allow-listed addresses were not verified against live deployments.** No network access; the seven fallback handlers, two modules, two migration contracts, four sign-message libraries and four CreateCall contracts are asserted by the code without a comment linking each to a source. A wrong or squatted address in any list is a silent R-4.1/R-4.2 bypass, but nothing in this checkout can confirm or refute them. Same for `staking.rs:66-74` and `cow.rs:89-102`.
- **Per AGENTS.md the checkers deliberately carry no verdict-level unit tests**, and under A8 the `sentinel-test-vectors` corpus is unavailable, so _every_ verdict claim in my findings is `E2` by construction. Each finding's `## Trigger` is written as a corpus-vector specification precisely so a QA agent can encode it when the corpus becomes available.
- **`RefundChecker` and `AddressPoisoningChecker` share one `Arc`** (`main.rs:52-72`, `checkers/mod.rs:39-48`), so fixing F-ENG-032 makes the refund path issue a second set of `eth_getLogs` calls per relayed transaction — doubling the per-request RPC cost that `address_poisoning.rs:150-155` already warns about. Worth stating in whichever fix lands.

### 7. Gaps and caveats in my own coverage

- Nothing was executed. No `cargo`, no test run, no PoC. Every claim is `E2` (cited code plus a concrete, precisely described attacker-supplied transaction) or `I` (Charter text, Safe/CoW/ComposableCoW contract behaviour, reqwest defaults) and is labelled as such per claim.
- Safe's `handlePayment` arithmetic (`(gasUsed + baseGas) * gasPrice`, the `tx.gasprice` cap for native refunds, no cap for ERC-20) underpins the _impact_ of F-ENG-031. `Safe.sol` is not in this checkout, so that step is class `I`; the engine-side claim (no affirmer reads the refund fields) is `E2` and is what the finding rests on.
- CoW's `GPv2Signing.setPreSignature`, `GPv2VaultRelayer` and `ComposableCoW.createWithContext` semantics are class `I` for the same reason and are flagged wherever relied upon (§5 items 13, F-ENG-037, F-ENG-038).
- Charter line ranges were verified against the session-local file with `awk` before each citation was written; the path itself will not survive the run, so every quote is reproduced in full inside the finding.

`crates/core/Dockerfile` does not exist (`core` is a library crate) — confirmed against baseline §4, not reported as missing.

#### Also read in full (other reviewers' files; read for the sweeps, no findings filed on them alone)

`crates/validator/src/config.rs` (290), `crates/sentinel/src/config.rs` (144), `crates/sentinel-engine/src/config.rs` (154), `crates/core/src/observability/mod.rs` (94), `crates/core/src/observability/logging.rs` (21), `crates/core/src/observability/metrics.rs` (80), `crates/core/src/metrics.rs` (90), `crates/validator/src/metrics.rs` (132), `crates/sentinel/src/metrics.rs` (134), `crates/core/src/effects.rs` (220), `crates/core/src/kdf.rs` (81), `crates/sentinel-engine/src/api/mod.rs` (60), `crates/sentinel-engine/src/api/extractors.rs` (69), `crates/sentinel-engine/src/main.rs` (87), `crates/validator/src/frost/error.rs` (46), the three `Dockerfile.dockerignore` files (4 each).

#### Read in part (specific ranges, for citation)

`crates/validator/src/service/effect.rs:1-130, 235-276`; `crates/validator/src/frost/keygen.rs:20-120, 425-530`; `crates/validator/src/frost/ecdh.rs:1-20` + grep of the whole file; `crates/validator/src/frost/preprocess.rs:30-70`; `crates/core/src/driver.rs:20-70, 236-263`; `crates/core/src/provider/mod.rs:55-166`; `crates/core/src/index/mod.rs:14-45`; `crates/core/src/index/blocks.rs:16-50`; `crates/core/src/tx/mod.rs:60-115, 340-370`; `crates/core/src/state/storage.rs:45-75`; `crates/core/src/tx/storage.rs:65-95`; `crates/validator/src/secrets/store.rs:60-95`; `crates/validator/src/main.rs:30-100`; `crates/sentinel/src/engine.rs:100-200`; `crates/sentinel-engine/src/checkers/address_poisoning.rs:150-215, 240-290, 300-385`.

#### Reference material (no findings)

`rust-audit/state/reviewer-brief.md` (76, 100%), `rust-audit/state/baseline.md` (404, 100%), `rust-audit/PROMPT.md` (231, 100%), `rust-audit/codebase-map.md` §1-5, §7-10 (~150 of 393 lines), §8 of all four analysis files (100% of each §8), plus the "considered and rejected" section of each analysis. `Justfile` (169, first 80 lines read; the rest is integration recipes), `.github/workflows/ci.yml` (39, 100%), `.github/workflows/docker.yml` (70, 100%), `.github/workflows/integration.yml` (first 40 lines), `docs/configuration.md` (83, 100%).

**Not read:** `crates/sentinel-engine/openapi.yaml` (R8's), the four analysis files outside §8 and their rejected lists, `docs/validator-handbook.md`, `docs/sentinel-handbook.md`, `docs/sentinel-engine.md`, `docs/overview.md`, `contracts/src`, the `epics/` folder. The three handbooks are cited indirectly through the samples' own comments; I did not verify those cross-references line by line, which is a gap the Coverage Critic should note against F-XC-009.

### 4. Consolidated panic and cast census (sweep 2) — re-derived, not copied

Method: a Python scanner (`census.py`) that first computes, per file, the line ranges belonging to a `#[cfg(test)]` item by brace matching, then greps the **remaining** lines for `unwrap`, `unwrap_err`, `expect(`, `panic!`, `unreachable!`, `todo!`, `unimplemented!`, `assert*!`, `as <intty|floatty>`, indexing, slicing and `unsafe`, skipping comment-only lines. Run over all 83 `.rs` files. This replaces, and is independent of, the four analyses' §8 tables.

#### 4.1 Totals, non-test code, whole workspace

| Construct | Count | Verdict |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `panic!` | **0** | — |
| `unreachable!` | **0** | — |
| `todo!` | **0** | — |
| `unimplemented!` | **0** | — |
| `unsafe` | **0** | confirms map §3 and baseline §3 |
| `unwrap` | **6** | all const/startup, none reachable from untrusted input |
| `expect(` | **15** | one latent (`cow.rs:130`), fourteen provably safe |
| `assert!` | **1** | `kdf.rs:20`, callers pass constants |
| `as` numeric casts | 25 | 6 metrics-only, rest widening or bounded |
| indexing / slicing | 43 / 38 (overlapping) | all fixed-size arrays or bounds-checked |

#### 4.2 Every `unwrap`/`expect`/`assert` in non-test code, with reachability and owner

| Location | Construct | Reachable from untrusted input? | Owner |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `core/src/utils.rs:20` | `unix::signal(SIGTERM).unwrap` | No — startup only, inside `#[tokio::main]` | R2 |
| `core/src/utils.rs:26` | `unix::signal(SIGINT).unwrap` | No — as above | R2 |
| `validator/src/config.rs:90` | `NonZeroU64::new(1440).unwrap` | No — `const fn`, literal | R6 |
| `validator/src/config.rs:94` | `NonZeroU64::new(120).unwrap` | No | R6 |
| `validator/src/config.rs:98` | `NonZeroU64::new(6).unwrap` | No | R6 |
| `validator/src/config.rs:102` | `NonZeroU64::new(12).unwrap` | No | R6 |
| `core/src/index/blocks.rs:336` | `.expect("the range scan always includes the safe block")` | No — loop runs ≥ once by `saturating_sub` at `:246` | R1 |
| `core/src/index/blocks.rs:457` | `.expect("checked len > max_reorg_depth above")` | No — guarded at `:453` | R1 |
| `core/src/index/events.rs:97` | `NonZeroU64::new(100).expect("100 is nonzero")` | No — literal | R1 |
| `core/src/index/events.rs:98` | `NonZeroU64::new(3).expect("3 is nonzero")` | No — literal | R1 |
| `core/src/index/events.rs:342` | `.expect("halving a nonzero page size stays nonzero")` | No — `div_ceil(2)` of ≥1 | R1 |
| `core/src/kdf.rs:25` | `.expect("32 bytes is far below HKDF-SHA256's maximum output length")` | No — fixed 32-byte OKM | R2 |
| `core/src/tx/mod.rs:354` | `.expect("valid regex")` | No — three static literals in a `LazyLock` | R3 |
| `sentinel-engine/src/checkers/cow.rs:130` | `u64::try_from(chain_id).expect("chain id expected to be in u64 range")` | **Latent** — today gated by `order_api_base_url` admitting only 1/100/42161 (`cow.rs:282-284`); a second caller of `compute_order_uid` makes it an HTTP 500 | R9 |
| `validator/src/consensus/group.rs:146` | `len.try_into.expect("group length is valid by construction")` | No — bounded by `u16::try_from` at `:206`,`:211` | R4 |
| `validator/src/frost/ecdh.rs:130` | `.expect("hash to secp256k1 scalar never fails…")` | No | R4 |
| `validator/src/frost/ecdh.rs:131` | `NonZeroScalar::new(u[0]).expect("hashing to zero is cryptographically impossible")` | Negligible | R4 |
| `validator/src/frost/participants.rs:18` | `Identifier::derive(..).expect(..)` | Negligible — needs HID(address) ≡ 0 mod n | R4 |
| `validator/src/frost/preprocess.rs:117` | `offset.checked_add(1).expect("chunk too large")` | No — offset < 1024 | R5 |
| `validator/src/frost/sign.rs:156` | `.expect("binding factor always serializes…")` | No — 32-byte canonical scalar | R5 |
| `validator/src/frost/sign.rs:159` | `.expect("binding factor is always a valid scalar")` | No | R5 |
| `core/src/kdf.rs:20` | `assert!(!domain.is_empty, ..)` | No — every caller passes a constant (`sentinel/src/hashing.rs:14`) | R2 |

**Conclusion: no attacker-reachable panic exists in non-test code.** `cow.rs:130` is the only site whose safety rests on a caller-set invariant rather than on the local types, and it is R9's. **No consolidated panic finding was filed** — filing one would inflate a clean result.

#### 4.3 Corrections to the four analyses' §8 censuses

| Analysis | Statement | Verdict |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `analysis-core.md:226-270` | the whole table | **Accurate.** Every `unwrap`/`expect` it lists exists at the stated line; no non-test site is missing from it. |
| `analysis-core.md:271` "No `panic!`, `unreachable!`, `todo!` or `unimplemented!` … in non-test code" |  | **Confirmed** workspace-wide, not just for `core`. |
| `analysis-validator.md:159-193` | the table | **Accurate but incomplete.** It omits three groups of fixed-size buffer writes that a mechanical sweep catches: `consensus/hashing.rs:125-135`, `frost/preprocess.rs:166-170`, `frost/sign.rs:172-177`, and `merkle.rs:90-91`. All four are writes into stack arrays of matching constant size and are provably safe, so the omission changes no conclusion — recorded so the Critic does not read the table as exhaustive. |
| `analysis-validator.md:171` cites `consensus/group.rs:143-146` |  | The `.expect` is on line **146**; `143-146` is the surrounding expression. Not an error, but a Critic re-opening `:143` alone will not find it. |
| `analysis-sentinel.md:173` "Non-test sentinel code contains **no** `unwrap`, `expect`, `panic!`, `unreachable!` or slice indexing" |  | **Confirmed exactly.** Zero hits in `crates/sentinel/src` across every category. |
| `analysis-sentinel-engine.md:239` "No `unreachable!`, `panic!`, `unwrap` or `expect` … besides `cow.rs:130`" |  | **Confirmed exactly** — one hit, at that line. |
| `analysis-sentinel-engine.md:240` "**Conclusion: no attacker-reachable panic/500 found; the decoders are total.**" |  | **Confirmed** by independent sweep. |

None of the four censuses overstates. The one systematic weakness is the validator's, which lists sites selectively rather than mechanically.

### 5. Dependency questions answered, and the ones that remain unanswerable (sweep 3)

**Answered statically:**

- _Are the two SHA-256 stacks ambiguous at any parity-critical call site?_ **No.** Every hash that must match Solidity is `alloy::primitives::keccak256`. The only two SHA-256 uses name their stack by import path: `k256::sha2::Sha256` (0.10.9) at `validator/frost/ecdh.rs:13,125` for hash-to-field, and plain `sha2::Sha256` (0.11.0) at `core/kdf.rs:5,22` under HKDF, whose output is the sentinel's local reveal salt and never a consensus value. Recorded in F-XC-007 basis rows 9-10 so it is not re-opened.
- _Does the validator's RNG share a `rand_core` line with FROST?_ **Yes** — `rand 0.8.6`, `frost-core 3.0.0` and `frost-secp256k1 3.0.0` all take `rand_core 0.6.4`, as do `elliptic-curve 0.13.8`, `ff`, `group`, `signature` and `crypto-bigint`. Independently proven by the fact that `keygen::setup`'s `&mut R` is passed straight into `dkg::part1`. Baseline §6 confirmed.
- _Features that widen surface:_ `alloy` `full` (ws/ipc/signer-local/tungstenite all in the lock), `tokio` `full` (includes `process`, unused), `sqlx` default features (pull `sqlx-mysql` and `sqlx-postgres` into the graph although only SQLite is used and no compile-time macro exists anywhere). Filed as F-XC-007.
- _A dependency for a trivial reason:_ `regex` in `core`, used for three literal case-insensitive substrings at `tx/mod.rs:362-367`. Filed as F-XC-007.
- _Lockfile hygiene:_ committed, format 4, and `--locked` is used by the clippy gate and all three Dockerfiles. No drift possible unnoticed. Not a finding.

**Unanswerable without a toolchain — this list is itself a deliverable:**

1. Any advisory or CVE status for any of the 516 packages (`cargo audit`).
2. Whether `serde_derive` accepts, rejects, or silently ignores `deny_unknown_fields` on a container with a `flatten` field, in the locked version (F-XC-003's open leg).
3. Whether `frost-core`'s `round1::SecretPackage` and `keys::KeyPackage` redact in `Debug` (F-XC-002's open leg) — the single highest-value question in this list.
4. Whether the linker actually strips the unused `sqlx-mysql`/`sqlx-postgres` code from the release binaries, i.e. whether F-XC-007 item 2 is a real size/surface reduction or only a build-time one.
5. `reqwest 0.13.4`'s actual default redirect and proxy policy (F-XC-008's basis row 8).
6. Which TLS root source `reqwest` selects under `default-features = false, features = ["json", "rustls"]`, and therefore whether the runtime images' `ca-certificates` is load-bearing.
7. Whether `cargo clippy -D warnings` currently passes — CI says it must, but nothing here observed it.
8. Whether `cargo tree -d`'s real output matches the lockfile-derived duplicate list in baseline §6 (the substitute was a text parse, and it cannot see feature-gated edges).

### 6. Hypotheses considered and rejected

#### Seeded leads I was told to start from

| Lead | Outcome |
| --- | --- |
| **VAL-H10** (secret structs derive `Debug`, logged at `warn`) | **Promoted and broadened** into F-XC-002. The analysis is right about `service/effect.rs:249` but stops there; the generic `core` sites (`effects.rs:55,59,78`, `driver.rs:238,261`) log every `Effect`, `Resume` and `Update` of _any_ service, which is the cross-cutting form. The analysis' 25% confidence understates the _pattern_ and correctly states the _leak_. Also corrected: the analysis implies all secret-bearing types derive `Debug`; four hand-write a redacting impl (`ecdh.rs:50`, `preprocess.rs:64`, `:150`, `signer.rs:96`) and exactly two do not. |
| **SEN-H14** (`reqwest::Client::new` defaults) | **Promoted and broadened** into F-XC-008. Confirmed at `engine.rs:113` and found a second, worse instance at `sentinel-engine/checkers/cow.rs:230` which additionally has _no timeout_, where the sentinel's does (`engine.rs:155`). |
| **SEN-H15** (private key lingers in an un-zeroized config `String`) | **Not promoted; left to R7.** It is a single-crate question about `Signer`'s `Deserialize`, and `core/tx/signer.rs:89-92` does zeroize on deserialization — the analysis itself cites that line as the contrast. I found no cross-crate pattern: the sentinel and validator both hold `Signer`, not a `String`, in their `Config`. The sample-config half of the concern is filed separately as F-XC-009 item 1. |
| **CORE-H17** (no chain-id / deployment binding) | **Promoted** to F-XC-006 at Low rather than the analysis' Informational, because the sweep shows it is workspace-wide (no config schema offers the field, the validator's _secret_ store shares the gap, and `docs/configuration.md:47` shows the legacy config had `CHAIN_ID=100`). Tagged `known`. Two partial guards found that the analysis does not mention and that cap the severity: `BlockTime::Auto` errors on any chain other than 100/11155111 (`blocks.rs:35-42`), and the validator's `getCoordinator` call fails against a chain where the configured address holds no contract (`main.rs:49-53`). |
| **ENG-H14** (docs understate external dependencies) | **Not promoted as such** — `docs/` is reference-only per the brief, so a documentation defect cannot be filed. Its checkable consequence _is_ filed: the engine's external dependency on `api.cow.fi` has no timeout (F-XC-008) and its RPC dependency has a sample value that disables a check (F-XC-005). The `/health`-on-the-metrics-port half is filed as F-XC-009 item 2. |

#### My own hypotheses, rejected with citations

| Hypothesis | Refuted by |
| --- | --- |
| A metric label is built from user or chain data, giving unbounded cardinality | Every label in `core/src/metrics.rs`, `validator/src/metrics.rs` and `sentinel/src/metrics.rs` is a `&'static str` returned by a `label` method on a closed enum. The single non-static label is `"method" => method.to_owned` (`core/src/metrics.rs:33`), whose value is `request.method` from an outgoing alloy RPC request (`core/src/provider/mod.rs:71`) — a closed set chosen by this codebase. |
| A secret reaches an HTTP error response from the engine | Both extractor rejections are `(StatusCode, &'static str)` (`api/extractors.rs:18-27`, `:39-47`), and the only response body is `Json<Verdict>` (`api/mod.rs:38,59`). The engine holds no keys at all. |
| A secret reaches a panic message | No `panic!` exists in non-test code (§4.1), and none of the 15 `expect` strings interpolates a value — all are static literals. |
| An error type's `Display` embeds a secret or a raw payload | `frost::Error` (`validator/frost/error.rs:10,16`) formats a `frost_secp256k1::Error` variant and an `Address`; `InternalError` (`validator/service/effect.rs:259-275`) stores `err.to_string` of that. `observability::InitError` (`core/observability/mod.rs:44,47`) formats library errors. None formats key material. |
| The signer private key leaks through `Debug` | `core/src/tx/signer.rs:96-100` hand-writes `Debug` to print the address only. Independently recorded in `analysis-core.md:503`. |
| The signing nonces leak through `Resume::Nonce` | `Nonces` redacts `signing_nonces` (`frost/preprocess.rs:64-70`); `NonceChunk` likewise at `:150`. |
| The samples do not parse against the schema | Each crate has a `parses_sample_config` test reading the real file from `CARGO_MANIFEST_DIR` (`validator/src/config.rs:282-289`, `sentinel/src/config.rs:136-143`, `sentinel-engine/src/config.rs:146-153`), and `just test` gates them. Sample-vs-schema drift is genuinely covered — which is why F-XC-009 is about the _values_, not the shape. |
| Config or secrets get baked into the published images | The runtime stage copies exactly one path, the binary; config arrives via `ENTRYPOINT` + `--config-file`. The builder stage is broader (see §7 observation 1) but is not pushed. |
| `crates/core` is missing a Dockerfile | `core` is a library crate; baseline §4 records that `crates/*/Dockerfile` resolves to three files. Not a defect. |
| The zero-address sample values start a misconfigured service silently | They do not: `consensus = 0x0` makes `Consensus::getCoordinator` fail to decode and `main` returns `Err` (`validator/src/main.rs:49-53`). This is the contrast that makes the _valid_ placeholders (the key, the zero salt) the real problem. |
| `block_chunks` can loop forever or overflow | `end = start.saturating_add(max_range).min(to)`, `done = end >= to`, and `from <= to` by `saturating_sub` (`address_poisoning.rs:191, 255-265`). Matches `analysis-sentinel-engine.md:225`. |
| Duplicate major versions are themselves a defect | The 43 duplicate names are ordinary transitive churn (`windows-*`, `hashbrown`, `syn`, arkworks). The two that would matter for correctness — the SHA-256 stacks and the `rand_core` line — were checked individually and both are clean (§5). |
| `sha2 0.11` in `core` risks a Solidity hashing mismatch | Core's `sha2` is used at exactly one place, `kdf.rs`, feeding HKDF for the sentinel's local reveal salt. Never a consensus hash. |
| CI's `cargo test --workspace` without `--locked` allows lock drift | `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets --locked` runs first in the same `just check` (`Justfile:29`), so a stale lock fails there. |
| `Cargo.lock` is absent or gitignored | Present, 6,169 lines, committed, format 4. |
| There are migration files whose SQL was not reviewed | `find crates -name '*.sql'` returns nothing; every schema is an inline `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` in Rust (four of them, all read). |

### 7. Observations (below the finding threshold, not dropped)

1. **Build-context breadth.** All three `Dockerfile.dockerignore` files are `/**` with `!/Cargo.toml`, `!/Cargo.lock`, `!/crates/**`, so everything under `crates/` enters the build context and the builder layer — including a real `validator.toml` or a `.sqlite` file a developer left beside the sample. The builder layer is not pushed, so this is not exposure today; a `!/crates/*/src/` + `!/crates/*/Cargo.toml` allowlist would be tighter.
2. **The sentinel-engine exports no metrics of its own.** There is no `metrics.rs` in the crate and no `metrics::` call outside `safenet-core`, so an operator has no counter for checker outcomes, verdict mix, or CoW/RPC failures. This is why F-XC-005's degradation is invisible. Probably R8's to file properly.
3. **`ca-certificates` may be dead weight.** If `reqwest 0.13` under `rustls` uses bundled `webpki-roots` (both 0.26.11 and 1.0.7 are in the lock), the runtime images' `ca-certificates` package is unused _and_, more importantly, adding a private CA to the system trust store would not work. Unverifiable without the dependency source (A6).
4. **`reqwest::Error`'s `Display` includes the request URL** (`sentinel/engine.rs:182` `tracing::error!(%err, ..)`). If an operator ever puts credentials in the engine URL, they may reach the log. Whether reqwest redacts userinfo is upstream and unverified.
5. **Axum's default `JsonRejection` body** echoes the serde error, which can include a field path and sometimes a value fragment, on a malformed `CheckRequest`. Under A3 the caller is the trusted sentinel, so Informational at most.
6. **`validator/src/service/action.rs:154`** computes `250_000 + 25_000 * share.f.len as u64` as a gas limit. It cannot overflow `u64` (the validator analysis is right), but at the `u16` bound it yields ~1.6 billion gas, far above any block gas limit, so the transaction would be unmineable rather than merely expensive. R6's to assess.
7. **No `EXPOSE` and no `HEALTHCHECK`** in any image; noted inside F-XC-004 rather than filed separately.
8. **`blocklist = []`** in the engine sample means the blocklist checker never denies. Documented as deliberate in the sample itself and inherently deployment-specific, so not filed.
9. **`tokio-metrics` spawns a background reporter** at `core/src/metrics.rs:89` inside `observability::init`. It panics outside a runtime; all three binaries call it inside `#[tokio::main]`. Safe today, fragile if `init` is ever called earlier. R2's.
10. **The map's §9 line totals for R2 and R9 are wrong** (1,993 vs 1,998 and 3,275 vs 3,471), as baseline §3 already records. Repeated here only so the Coverage Critic sees it corroborated.

### 8. Gaps and blockers

- No toolchain: `E1` is unreachable, and the eight questions in §5 stay open. Every finding I wrote states which of its legs is `I` for this reason.
- I did not read the three service handbooks, which several sample-config comments point at. If a handbook already warns about the placeholder key or the `0.0.0.0` bind, F-XC-009's severity should drop; a Critic with budget should check `docs/validator-handbook.md` "Secrets" and `docs/sentinel-engine.md` before finalising it.
- `Cargo.lock` was parsed programmatically rather than read line by line (§2).
- No blocker prevented completion of any of the five sweeps.
