# Safenet Testnet Validator Handbook

This document provides a brief guide to operating a Safenet Testnet validator.

## Introduction

Safenet Testnet is a decentralized Safe transaction security network where validators coordinate to generate cryptographic attestations for Safe transactions. Validators are run by independent parties to maintain decentralization and prevent a single entity from producing invalid attestations that could compromise Safenet’s security guarantees.

In the initial testnet release, Safenet validators communicate entirely onchain. This simplifies validator operations: only a stable RPC node connection is required, and the system does not need to be exposed to the public internet.

For more information on Safenet, consult the [technical overview](./overview.md) as well as the [general public docs](https://docs.safefoundation.org/safenet). See the [sentinel handbook](./sentinel-handbook.md) for the sentinel side of the protocol.

## Requirements

### System

The Safenet Testnet validator node is distributed as an OCI container image that can run on any OCI-compatible runtime (Docker, Podman, etc.). The validator is lean and can run on a single core (with average CPU usage under 5%) and less than 500 MB of RAM (1 GB is recommended to handle spikes). Currently, only Linux x86-64 images are distributed.

Additionally, the validator node stores intermediate state in a SQLite database file. This file contains critical runtime information and should be backed up. Loss of this data would prevent the validator from correctly participating in consensus for the duration of an epoch.

### Infrastructure

#### Ethereum RPC

To run a validator, you need a reliable Ethereum RPC node that can accommodate a peak of 100.000 requests per day. The following table shows the approximate breakdown by RPC method (exact ratios depend on Safenet activity):

| eth_getBlockByNumber | eth_sendRawTransaction | eth_maxPriorityFeePerGas | eth_getLogs | eth_getTransactionCount |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 42% | 8% | 11% | 11% | 28% |

##### `eth_getLogs` Reliability

Unfortunately, some RPC providers are unreliable with `eth_getLogs` requests: if the logs are queried too soon after a block is observed then an empty array will be returned even if there are logs in that block. This seems to affect RPC providers that use older versions of Nethermind before 1.36.

The integrity of logs are critical for proper validator operation. In order to work around these RPC issues, the validators have a built-in mechanism to check log query integrity at the cost of additional bandwidth. If you have reason to believe your RPC may not reliably return all logs, then enable the following configuration in the `[index]` table of your [configuration file](../crates/validator/validator.sample.toml):

```toml
[index]
use_client_filtering = true
```

#### Logging and Metrics

The validator node writes JSON-formatted logs to standard output. It also exposes Prometheus metrics over HTTP, bound by default to an ephemeral port on `localhost` (inconvenient if running from a container). Set `metrics_address` in the `[observability]` table of your [configuration file](../crates/validator/validator.sample.toml) to bind elsewhere, e.g.:

```toml
[observability]
metrics_address = "0.0.0.0:3555"
```

### Secrets

#### `secp256k1` Validator Key

Each validator must be provisioned with a `secp256k1` private key. This key is used to authenticate the validator onchain for participation in Safenet Testnet. It must be funded with sufficient gas for the EVM transactions required for onchain consensus-related communication.

> [!TIP] The validator currently requires the private key at startup and does not support any KMS systems. Do not use this key for anything else, especially security-related tasks. Use it only for validating, and fund it only with the amount needed for gas. In the future, we plan to support KMS systems for more secure setups.

##### Gas Costs

The exact amount varies by chain, but you can expect the account to consume roughly 1.000.000.000 gas per day under peak load. The actual cost of that gas depends on network congestion.

Safenet Testnet’s onchain components are planned for deployment on Gnosis Chain. In a six-month sample window (Aug 25, 2025 – Feb 25, 2026), the average base fee per gas was approximately 0.042 Gwei, translating to just under $0.05 per day in gas costs. However, daily average base fee per gas reached as high as 3.4 Gwei. Based on these figures, validators should expect to need roughly $10 in tokens to cover gas costs over a comparable six-month period; treat this as a rough, dated estimate rather than a current guarantee, and recheck prevailing Gnosis Chain gas prices before funding a validator. It is recommended to overfund the validator to account for base gas fee variability.

> [!TIP] On Gnosis Chain, the base fee is very low relative to the priority fee, so the priority fee makes up the bulk of gas costs. If your RPC occasionally returns an inflated `eth_maxPriorityFeePerGas` estimate, you can cap how much of the total fee cap can be a tip using the `[transactions]` table of your [configuration file](../crates/validator/validator.sample.toml). For example, setting `priority_fee_cap_percentage = 95` ensures the tip never exceeds 95% of `maxFeePerGas`, protecting against runaway estimates while still allowing normal inclusion.

#### Consensus Secrets

While participating in consensus, validators generate short-term secrets required to attest Safe transactions and participate correctly. Specifically, it generates:

- Secret coefficients used for distributed key generation once per epoch
- A secret signing share used for attesting Safe transactions once per epoch
- Secret nonce pairs that are used in signing ceremonies producing Safe transaction attestations once per signing sequence chunk (i.e. once every 1024 signatures)

Loss of these secrets would prevent the validator from participating in consensus until new ones are computed, and it would forgo protocol rewards during that period. Ensure this information survives restarts. In the current implementation, the validator stores these secrets in an SQLite database on disk. Operators must ensure the file persists across restarts and is backed up in case of failure.

> [!IMPORTANT] The secrets are stored in plaintext and are not encrypted in the SQLite database. **Treat the validator database file as containing secret keys**, and apply sufficient restrictions to prevent unauthorized access. **Never share this file with anyone, including the Safenet team for debugging**.

##### Secret Retention

Secrets are not deleted the moment they stop being needed. When the validator observes that a group no longer needs one, it records a deletion deadline of the block it observed at, and deletes it only once that block falls outside the reorg window — the same boundary the validator prunes its state snapshots to. Until then the secret remains readable and usable, so a rollback that brings the group back cancels the pending deletion instead of losing the material. Expect a validator's database to hold secrets for groups it has already finished with, for roughly the depth of the configured reorg window.

Two Prometheus metrics report this. `safenet_validator_secrets_total{kind}` is a gauge of what the database currently holds, counting secrets that are scheduled for deletion but not yet collected:

- `{kind="keygen"}` counts DKG secret rows, one per group.
- `{kind="nonces"}` counts nonce **chunks**, each holding 1024 nonces — not individual nonces.

It is read from the database at startup and tracked from there, so it describes the file on disk rather than what this run of the validator happens to have done. A level that climbs steadily is the signal that collection is not keeping up.

`safenet_validator_housekeeping_total{result="success"|"failure"}` counts collection passes, one per new block. A pass that finds nothing due is a success. Sustained `failure` means the database is rejecting writes, in which case secrets accumulate rather than being lost.

> [!NOTE] Deadlines are ordered by block number, which does not distinguish between chain branches. After a deep rollback, or a restart that replays past the point where a group was dropped, a deadline recorded on an earlier branch can come due before the validator re-registers the group. The validator then treats the secret like any other that is missing: the signing ceremony that needed it is skipped, and the group times it out or retries it. Deleted secrets are not recreated — a fresh DKG secret cannot reproduce an existing commitment, and a nonce cannot be regenerated once its chunk is gone — so this can cost participation in a ceremony. It cannot cost correctness: a nonce is never reused, whether or not it survives.

## Running

Configure the validator by writing a TOML configuration file — see [`crates/validator/src/config.rs`](../crates/validator/src/config.rs) for the full schema, and copy [`validator.sample.toml`](../crates/validator/validator.sample.toml) as a worked example to start from.

```sh
cp crates/validator/validator.sample.toml validator.toml
$EDITOR validator.toml
```

Use the provided OCI image to run the validator, passing the configuration file's path via `--config-file`. The image's `ENTRYPOINT` is the `validator` binary itself, so this flag is appended directly as the container command. For example, with `docker` and assuming `database` in `validator.toml` points at a file under `/var/lib/safenet/validator/data`:

```sh
docker run --name safenet-validator \
    --volume "$(pwd)/validator.toml:/usr/src/app/validator.toml" \
    --volume validator-data:/var/lib/safenet/validator/data \
    ghcr.io/safe-research/safenet-validator:main \
    --config-file=validator.toml
```

## Debugging

There are a few things you can do to verify your validator is running as expected:

- Check the logs. For example, if running with `docker`:
  ```sh
  docker logs --follow safenet-validator
  ```
- Check the validator EVM account on a block explorer. There should be recent transactions to the `Consensus` and `FROSTCoordinator` contracts.

### Common Problems

- Ethereum node RPC issues:
  - Rate limits. While the validator implements exponential backoff for some RPC requests, rate limits can still prevent full participation in Safenet Testnet.
  - Missing logs. Some RPC providers do not reliably return all logs for `eth_getLogs` requests. This issue can be mitigated with the appropriate configuration (see [`eth_getLogs` Reliability](#eth_getlogs-reliability)).
- Insufficient funds on the validator account to submit onchain transactions. Logs will show that `actions` could not be submitted because of insufficient gas.
